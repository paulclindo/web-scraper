    "synopsis": "In this New York Times bestseller, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers—“fans of geography, history, and politics (and maps) will be enthralled” (Fort Worth Star-Telegram).\n\nMaps have a mysterious hold over us. Whether ancient, crumbling parchments or generated by Google, maps tell us things we want to know, not only about our current location or where we are going but about the world in general. And yet, when it comes to geo-politics, much of what we are told is generated by analysts and other experts who have neglected to refer to a map of the place in question.\n\nAll leaders of nations are constrained by geography. In “one of the best books about geopolitics” (The Evening Standard), now updated to include 2016 geopolitical developments, journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the US, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan, Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.\n\nOffering “a fresh way of looking at maps” (The New York Times Book Review), Marshall explains the complex geo-political strategies that shape the globe. Why is Putin so obsessed with Crimea? Why was the US destined to become a global superpower? Why does China’s power base continue to expand? Why is Tibet destined to lose its autonomy? Why will Europe never be united? The answers are geographical. “In an ever more complex, chaotic, and interlinked world, Prisoners of Geography is a concise and useful primer on geopolitics” (Newsweek) and a critical guide to one of the major determining factors in world affairs.",

US Veterans whom have read it and either \"trained\" for and or \"fought\" in regions discussed claim it to be a \"highly\" militarily factual representation of the \"challenges\" faced in various Global \"theaters\" of operation not only geographically but also \"politically\" with very few errors.... in authors \"assessments\"!!!! Furthermore, \"technologically\" and \"demographically\" it points out numerous \"interesting\" points, such as on page number 242 were the author asserts \"America is an Arctic nation without an Arctic strategy in a region that is heating up.\" Furthermore, the author points out on page 251 of hard copy, that in 2014 Russia conducted \"military exercises\" in the Arctic Region with 155,00 troops and the exercise opponents were in fact named \"Missouri\" and \"an unnamed Asian power [Japan] which had already clashed with Russia\" in the past (Sino-Russian Conflict; WWIII etc..)! (Do not recall these simple facts making it into main-stream American Media reporting-interestingly enough!) Furthermore, IAW author in the case of the former Tsarist Russian Empire-Soviet Union, its leaders purposely left \"pockets\" of pro-Soviet/Russian populations in place as the Empire expanded and/or contracted to utilize various \"political\" reasons....if it so chose!!!! Interesting point!\n\nAs far as Latin America or South America, the author really hits home the fact most of the \"continents\" population resides along the coasts and the numerous difficulties in establishing development in the vast interior, and issues arising from this such as \"deforestation\" of the rain forest, as well as numerous difficulties these nations face in bringing \"goods\" from the interior to port, etc....! On this note, in the \"conclusion\" on page 260- the author states \"To take an extreme and unlikely scenario: imagine a majority Hispanic Florida has seceded from the United States and allied itself with Cuba or Mexico. This would alter only the dynamics of whom controlled the Gulf, not the importance of the location!\" Clearly, a very poignant point about the total and absolute \"importance\" of geography and too some extent \"demographics\" and its role in shaping national strategic policies.....not only in the US but around the Globe!\n\nThe author, also has a very interesting take on \"Africa\" and the countless issues facing nations there and those other nations involved there for various reasons. The author makes a point of \"hammering\" home the massive Chinese involvement in nations in Africa and why other nations must also follow suit to some degree, not only in Africa but around the Globe as well.\n\nFinally, the author touches on points of \"global\" warming and the impacts it may play Globally as well as \"outer-space\" and numerous global national issues there as well.\n\nIn a nut shell this is must read- well informed, factual work- from most all perspectives (Military, Political, Technological Etc..) for those interested in Global Politics and Current Affairs!",

        "comment": "I like the perspective this book offers, namely viewing world affairs as driven by and constrained by national and regional geography. Author Tim Marshall divides our planet into ten large areas whose external boundaries and internal divisions shape the behavior of those who live within them, in particular, that of leaders and governments.\n\nTen maps preface each of the ten chapters while providing a frequent go-to reference for readers as Marshall explores how landforms, rivers, plains, and ports have affected the politics and conflicts in each region. I did not detect any wasted space or filler material in this book; in fact, it is jammed with useful insights and \"ahas\" about the world today. I do not have anything to offer in the way of shortcomings: it's just a conceived book on a topic that gets little attention.\n\nWhy does Russia want Ukraine? What motivates China to build a major port facility on the Indian Ocean in Pakistan? How does geography help to explain the contrast between European and African economic development? Which countries are preparing for conflict in the Arctic as sea ice retreats further year after year? The beauty of this book lies in placing a global basket of territorial imperatives side by side, map by map so that the reader gets a holistic view of geopolitics.\n\nThe book raised my awareness about the role of geography in the politics of conflict. Argentina still wants the Malvinas (Falkland Islands), climate change drives a serious Nile River water-rights dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt, and several international conflicts simmer in the Arctic region. More than a score of geographically-driven political hot spots exist around the world, all neatly presented in this book in their geographical context.\n\nPrisoners of Geography is a must-read if you follow geopolitics. If you do not, you may find yourself both fascinated and better informed after reading it.",

        "comment": "A well written interesting read. That said I think the thesis of the book can be summed up as “geography matters, except when it doesn’t”. Also, I think the author somewhat overstates the general lack of understanding of and/or appreciation for geographic realities. For instance, I think some of the supposed insights in the book (a warm water port is a top policy priority for Russia, the U.S. has been blessed with numerous natural advantages, mountainous rugged countries are generally poorer than flatter more verdant ones) are widely understood and accepted.\n\nFurthermore, the author can come across as frustrated and even bitter that, at least in his view, geography isn’t taken more seriously. This is particularly true when he discusses European colonialism. He seems to suggest that colonialism would be more benign if it didn’t involve arbitrarily drawing national boundaries and ignoring historic ethnic tensions. But it seems to me that’s largely what colonialism is, so I don’t quite get the point. I mean I think most people would agree that colonialism has had some horrific consequences. But would colonized parts of the world be better off if they’d never been colonized? At that point you’re really getting into speculative alternate history stuff which probably doesn’t get you anywhere.\n\nBut all in all, I found the book a worthwhile read.",

    "synopsis": "“A shocking saga of pharmaceutical malpractice . . . Wonder Drug is both a first-rate medical thriller and the searing account of a forgotten American tragedy.”—Patrick Radden Keefe, author of Empire of Pain\n \nA “fascinating and compassionate” (People) account of the most notorious drug of the twentieth century and the never-before-told story of its American survivors.\n\nIn 1959, a Cincinnati pharmaceutical firm, the William S. Merrell Company, quietly began distributing samples of an exciting new wonder drug already popular around the world. Touted as a sedative without risks, thalidomide was handed out freely, under the guise of clinical trials, by doctors who believed approval by the Food and Drug Administration was imminent. \n\nBut in 1960, when the application for thalidomide landed on the desk of FDA medical reviewer Frances Kelsey, she quickly grew suspicious. When she learned that the drug was causing severe birth abnormalities abroad, she and a team of dedicated doctors, parents, and journalists fought tirelessly to block its authorization in the United States and stop its sale around the world.\n\nJennifer Vanderbes set out to write about this FDA success story only to discover a sinister truth that had been buried for decades: For more than five years, several American pharmaceutical firms had distributed unmarked thalidomide samples in shoddy clinical trials, reaching tens of thousands of unwitting patients, including hundreds of pregnant women. \n\nAs Vanderbes examined government and corporate archives, probed court records, and interviewed hundreds of key players, she unearthed an even more stunning find: Scores of Americans had likely been harmed by the drug. Deceived by the pharmaceutical firms, betrayed by doctors, and ignored by the government, most of these Americans had spent their lives unaware that thalidomide had caused their birth defects. \n \nNow, for the first time, this shocking episode in American history is brought to light. Wonder Drug gives voice to the unrecognized victims of this epic scandal and exposes the deceptive practices of Big Pharma that continue to endanger lives today.",

        "comment": "Jennifer Vanderbes's Wonder Drug is an enthralling, impossible-to-put-down exploration of one of the great tragedies perpetuated by drug companies upon unsuspecting (and trusting) victims. The drug, Thalidomide (sold and \"freely\" distributed under various names and derivatives as a sedative in the late 1950s and early 1960s), caused phocomelia (a shortening of the \"limb/s being reduced or missing and leaving distal elements (handplate) in place\" (National Institutes of Health). If you've ever seen a thalidomide baby, you've likely seen a photograph of a baby with \"flipper-like\" hands and/or feet. Many of those babies are now in their sixties; plenty died or were forgotten about once they were born, swaddled and pulled from their mothers and either put in homes or taken care of in other ways.\n\nThe William S. Merrell Company had been inundating medical facilities with pills that were causing severe birth defects, passing the pills off as remedies for such things as insomnia, morning sickness, and headaches, and it indeed felt like a \"wonder drug.\" But the truth of that wonder drug was far from what was being claimed. It soon became apparent that “ten thousand babies worldwide” at the time were killed or born with deformed limbs and/or defective organs due to the drug. As I read these facts and as a father myself, I couldn’t fathom what these parents had gone through. It angered me.\n\nThe evolution and importance of the FDA, and how it altered the safety of the American public, materialized during the time of the thalidomide tragedy. But it was a slow process.\n\nThe story of thalidomide as a tested and effective drug reviewed by doctors and scientists was horrific. From Nazi experimentation with the drug in concentration camps to a lack of due diligence by the gatekeepers of healthcare around the globe, patients seeking relief from various ailments were treated as Guinea pigs. Many of them died, yet doctors continued to prescribe the drug, even before animal testing was completed, if any testing was ever completed at all. To say that the industry dropped the ball would be to put it mildly. But no one seemed to care, except a brave, inquisitive, and tough Dr. named Frances Kelsey, who brought thalidomide's dangers to light and pushed for its halt as the drug of choice for so many doctors.\n\nThe scientific evaluations being done were too rushed, but, for the drug companies, the profits were too tempting. Inevitably, due to the rules of the game at the FDA, those testing the medications had 60 days to kill them. But 60 days often wasn’t enough time to conduct the trials. And so the runaway trains of profit over people were set free.\n\nThe reality was that the politics of the early days of the FDA and its association with the drug manufacturers it was supposedly overseeing was not what it is today. What it was during the days of thalidomide's introduction into the hands of patients can be considered criminal. Profits above human decency seemed the norm. Trials were either not performed, performed inadequately, or simply overlooked in terms of what the actual results were. Thalidomide, or Kevadon, as it was called by the drug manufacturer Richardson-Merrell, was pushed to the public the way a street corner drug dealer pushes their product to their neighborhoods—except it was much worse, because Merrell had the financial ability to market their drugs heavily, all while sending an army of detail men (sales reps) to supplement demand.\n\nTime and again, the need, or the results, of safety research, was sidelined, all for the profit of the companies hawking pills that would ultimately be proven lethal or extremely damaging, in particular to the unborn children of women given the medicine.\n\nVanderbes is brilliant at breaking down the way the medicine makes its way from the manufacturer to the detail men, to the receptive doctors or \"clinical investigators\" who would provide the drugs to their patients (these doctors were known as Dr. Backslappers), who then prescribed the meds to patients (or passed them along to other doctors, who were not clinical investigators), effectively making it impossible for accountability if anything went wrong, as the chain of custody of the medicine was lost.\n\nIn the hurricane of drug pushing for profit, ethical, detail-oriented doctors at the FDA like Dr. Frances Kelsey, sought to put a stop to the Wild Wild West days of profits over patients.\n\nYet the immorality of some of the doctors involved with the thalidomide tragedy, including a thoroughly repugnant study they executed on minors with brain damage in Bonn, Germany (where the drug was known as Contergan) is mind-boggling. That so many doctors went along with human trials of a drug proving fatal to so many will leave the reader not only astonished but wondering how such a thing could happen at all.\n\nBut what Vanderbes does so well is shed light on exactly how something so horribly wrong and unethical could happen in the shadow of WWII and in the 20th century, given all the progress the world had made. Shady business relationships between medical companies and medical journals was one factor that contributed to the problem. Another was that doctors who wished to publish their findings about the harmful effects of Thalidomide were often “delayed.” Yes, the world was different back then, but one has to ask themselves, Where was the decency? Where was the morality of all involved? Had these people and companies no shame?\n\nTime after time after time, the drug companies selling Thalidomide hid any mention of safety findings related to the cash cow drug lining their pockets. Some of the companies outright lied, or contrived ways to get around halting the sale of it, which, by 1961, was in about 42 countries. Babies were being born with extremely malformed limbs and other birth defects, and the mothers and families of these children were being kept in the dark as to why. Responsibility was a game of hot potato no one wanted to play. so no one was held to account. Not the doctors, who didn’t have to tell patients what they were giving them, nor that the drugs they were being given had reported birth abnormalities, not the drug companies, who misled the FDA, nor, it seemed, anybody else involved with the spread of the wonder drug.\n\nTo mitigate the losses that acknowledging the drug's issues might cause, A Merrell press release “affirmed that thalidomide was ‘never sold in the United States.’\" But as Vanderbes makes clear, “sold” did not mean not distributed. \"At the time of Merrell’s “premarket distribution of [thalidomide, it was] . . . the largest in U.S. history.”\n\nBut then, in 1960, things began to change. A paper was published in the British Medical Journal, and the FDA in America caught on. Merrell was eventually found to have put the drug out into the market and then suppressed data and submitted false data in its Kevadon application. More companies followed suit. Once it was abundantly clear that the house of cards would fall, Grunenthal, the German seller of the drug, settled with its affected patients, rather than go to trial. But the damage was done. 150,000 worldwide victims were affected, 45 nations had thalidomide in circulation, and, in effect, it was still the Wild Wild West on who had thalidomide and where it was still being prescribed (or given out).\n\nWhile Thalidomide was later found to be beneficial for treating certain symptoms of AIDS and leprosy, the WHO (the World Health Organization) put the kabash on its use due to “murky” research on the drug’s efficacy. Things have changed recently with how thalidomide and its variants are used, but none of this changes what happened to the thousands upon thousands of victims whose lives were either cut short or adversely affected for the duration of their entire lives.\n\nVanderbes's book is a must read, especially if you want to get a detailed understanding of how drug companies used to work (and hopefully a reminder of how things have changed since those days). It's also a history lesson in what women had to do in order to succeed in educational and career opportunities where the organizations they wanted to be a part of were overwhelmingly chauvanistic. The drug companies and even the FDA were geared towards men, directed by men, and the entire industry was controlled by the profit specific men reaped through the sale of thalidomide and other drugs. Women like Dr. Frances Kelsey and others paved the way for change. They were the champions of patients being lied to, manipulated, and physically and mentally affected by everything the drug companies in their quest for profits brought down upon them with neither their consent nor knowledge. What happened to the patients of thalidomide is horrific, and Vanderbes's book is a testament to why such a travesty should never happen again. Buy the book, and read it. Now. As a participant in the health industry, whether as a patient, a doctor, or any other role you may hold when it comes to healthcare, you should be aware of the history of thalidomide, if even just to know what to look out for any time a doctor says, \"I'd like to prescribe you this . . . .\"",

        "comment": "This book for me has been 61 years in the making. I am a character in the book — honestly, I really am. And so are a lot of my friends from U.S. Thalidomide Survivors, a nonprofit formed only a few years ago in 2018. This book is us. This book literally helped us find each other.\n\nCan you imagine wondering all of your life why you look like all of the thalidomide survivors in Europe, and asking questions of doctors all your life, but being told that the FDA never approved the drug in our country, and it was never here? Can you imagine rewriting your history when you were in your late 50s? Finally learning the truth?\n\nThat is why I say this book will change history. It already is doing so. While it was previously mis-reported that the US escaped the thalidomide tragedy, this book shows us all that it did not. It introduces new information.\n\nJennifer Vanderbes illuminates the disturbing story of how thalidomide was handed out by United States drug companies, eager to get ahead of what they thought would be FDA approval (which never came) to doctors all across the country; who, in turn, gave it out to patients who often did not know what drug they were being given. This included pregnant women. This included my mother.\n\nAnd her book goes on to show how US authorities, including the FDA, did not adequately investigate once the dangers of thalidomide were discovered. They did not track down the patients who had received it. They did not notify the unwitting victims and failed to find the babies affected.\n\nWonder Drug is a riveting read, so well-told and well-researched! The old statistics are out and the new ones are here. The casualties of this dark chapter in American history come to life in Jennifer’s book. I personally am proud she did our stories justice. Please read, share, and amplify this important new truth!",

        "comment": "As the older brother of one of the Thalidomide survivors mentioned in the book, I listened to this gripping and thoroughly researched book with a mixture of tears and initial disbelief that often transformed into anger. If you think hardly any were affected by Thalidomide in the US, you are wrong. If you think the pharmaceutical company practices that led to this tragedy were stopped in the last century, you are wrong. If you think that all survivors have been supported, acknowledged, and compensated for those practices, you are wrong.\n\nThis author reveals and documents truths that the FDA to this day will not publicly admit. She also paints a set of deeply personal portraits of these amazing people who have been ignored and erased from history for far too long. This book is an illuminating and gripping read. It has been the one book this summer I rarely put down. Except to wipe away tears.",

    "synopsis": "From the Crime Files of New York Times bestselling author Ann Rule, the true story of a man who killed his lover's husband, his second wife, and kidnapped his own child.\n\nA cold case reopened—and solved—with dogged police work and new evidence. One of the shocking true crimes of passion and greed from Ann Rule's Crime Files.\n\nFormer Marine sergeant and judo instructor Roland Pitre Jr. claimed it was all an elaborate plan to win back his wife's love—it wasn't supposed to end with her dead body in the trunk of a car. Nearly twenty years later, he acknowledged that he had hired someone to kill his estranged wife in 1988, though his alleged excuse for why a monstrous \"mistake\" happened is as shocking and convoluted as the crime itself. Eventually, he was charged with first-degree murder in the long-unsolved death of Cheryl Pitre, after a mysterious witness betrayed Pitre to save his own skin. Tracing back the dark and bloody path of Pitre's life, two generations of detectives found a chain of brutal and terrifying crimes by a man who manipulated the courts and prisons to walk free.",

        "comment": "I often interject myself into my reviews, not because I have a huge ego, but rather, I think that if someone who reads my reviews knows where I'm coming from then he or she will be better able to determine if my opinion has merit for him or her. I mean, if you look at most of my reviews, they're for either true-crime books or true-crime television shows. So if you see that I give a high rating for something and you aren't a fan of the genre then you'll know that my review really won't apply to you. And then you'll move on and consider making a different purchase, even if I give it a recommendation. That is totally fine by me. After all, my review is for you and not for me.\n\nGetting that out of the way, I bought \"Worth More Dead\" (WMD) by Ann Rule for a number of reasons, a few of which I'll list here:\n\n1. Overall I like Ms. Rule's books. There are certainly better true-crime authors -- Jack Olsen comes to mind immediately -- but then again, Ms. Rule was an excellent writer and she rarely if ever made a grammar error. If you read true crime you will know that is a rarity. Unfortunately though, neither Ms. Rule nor Mr. Olsen are with us anymore. So all of the books they'll ever write have presumably already been published. That is certainly a shame.\n2. I used to live in the Seattle area before moving a decade ago to the Bay Area. There are probably five stories in WMD and probably at least three are set in Seattle, or nearby. I usually prefer reading true crime in areas where I live or have lived as it makes it come more alive to me. And since I know the area the story will usually make more sense to me as well.\n3. I used to know one of the detectives listed in one of the stories. I won't say which story and I won't say which detective. But it is the case that I lost track of him right around the time he was investigating a true-crime case in this book and so it added to the story for me as I was able to see what he was up to during those \"lost years.\"\n4. It's not mandatory but I far prefer books in the Kindle format. I can read them on any device I want, I can download them anywhere I am, and it auto-saves bookmarks for me. Plus, I don't have to have a stack of paper backs or hardcovers that continues to build up around the house. Instead I have digital books that \"build up\" on my devices, and they don't \"eat\" very much hard drive or SSD space, which is good.\n\nSo I went into WMD fairly intrigued, and I was motivated to read at a fairly good clip. I got through most of the book in the first few days, and then took my time with the rest of the stories as I had time. Overall, I will say that most if not all of the stories in WMD are beyond interesting, some more so than others.\n\nThe first story is probably the longest and the most complicated. It was beyond intriguing, and it took place in the Seattle area. So far so good for me. In reality though, the story became so complex that my head started to spin. I did think that the criminals involved in the tale spent WAY too much time maybe watching \"Murder She Wrote,\" however. I mean, if you're going to commit crime, without having done it myself, I think the old acronym KISS might be in order: \"Keep it simple stupid.\" These criminals seemingly wanted to commit the most complicated crimes known to man, maybe because they figured it would confuse the police. Well, it did for awhile. Until it didn't.\n\nThere is another story that I found intriguing about a guy that I used to watch on the local news in the Seattle area. He did special-interest stories but unfortunately got himself mixed up in murder and mayhem. That's all that I will write to hold the suspense for you, if you decide to buy and read WMD. The rest of the stories were certainly interesting and weren't just \"page fillers.\" There were interesting enough that I feel Ms. Rule was warranted adding them here.\n\nI will write that \"Worth More Dead\" is surely not the best true-crime book I've ever bought and read. But the stories were very interesting to me, once again, and so overall I'm glad I made the purchase. You? Well, if you like true crime, if you're a fan of Ann Rule, and maybe if you're interested in true-crime stories mostly in the Seattle area it should be right up your alley. And in that case I will give it a fairly strong recommendation for a purchase.",

Along the way to writing and releasing her Big Books, she gathers chaff which never quite made it into a book of its own - hence these \"Ann Rule Crime Files\" paperbacks of which this is the 10th. There is one bigger/small novella length crime coverage and then the \"stocking stuffers.\" So, about once a year, Rule's readers get appetizers - not the \"Full Meal Deals\" that are Ann's forte. Still, a not-up-to-her-best Rule is better than the best of most of the rest in the genre. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",

        "comment": "Douglass argues the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the superpowers to the brink of a nuclear war, profoundly changed JFK. During the emergency, JFK's hawkish cabinet and Pentagon officials pressured him to attack Cuba. Had he done so, we have since learned, Russian soldiers in Cuba possessed 130 Soviet nuclear-armed missiles with which they could have annihilated the US. Kennedy's restraint in the face of his advisors' hot-headed, maniacal demands for war with the USSR saved the world from a nuclear conflagration.\n\nBut Kennedy's problems with the hawks began before the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the Bay of Pigs. The plan to overthrow the Castro regime had been hatched under the Eisenhower administration. Cuban exiles were assisted by the CIA in a plan that involved sending armed exiles onto the shores of Cuba. The right-wing exiles and their backers in the CIA hoped JFK would be pressured into sending US troops and/or air support for the attack, but JFK refused both. The exile brigade surrendered and more than one thousand were imprisoned in Cuba. Following that episode, an angry JFK said he wanted \"to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.\"\n\nFor his refusal to countenance a nuclear war with the USSR over Cuba, the sociopathic hawks in the Pentagon and CIA saw JFK as \"weak.\" Many in the Cuban exile community in Miami also hated him for failing to provide air support to their illegal invasion. Five months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK delivered a visionary address to the UN, calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons \"before they abolish us...\" This speech could not have thrilled the manufacturers of nuclear weapons nor the hawks in the Pentagon, who were pushing for a nuclear first strike against the USSR.\n\nIn September 1961, JFK and Khrushchev began a back channel correspondence that lasted the remainder of JFK's life. Despite their differences, they came to a mutual understanding of the need for disarmament and détente. The understanding reached via this channel of communication helped save both of them from knuckling under to their more hawkish advisors during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIn November 1961 Kennedy ordered advisors and support units to Vietnam, beginning a steady buildup. Yet six months later he issued National Security Action Memorandum 239, including orders to withdraw all US military personnel from Vietnam by the end of 1963. He had already decided Vietnam was a lost cause; it wasn't our war to fight.\n\nIn April of 1962 he forced the steel industry leaders to rescind price increases that violated a JFK-brokered agreement to fight inflation. When they balked, he canceled Pentagon contracts with the industry, earning him the wrath of the power brokers in the Military Industrial Complex. The next month, he ordered Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to command General Paul Harkins to devise a plan for turning the Vietnam War over to the South Vietnamese and reducing the size of the US military command there.\n\nIt is uncertain when exactly JFK crossed the line--from pissing off the suits in the CIA and Military Industrial Complex, to their decision to kill him. But it might well have happened before the missile crisis. His support of a coalition government in Laos over a more militarized approach didn't help his cause. A turning point may have been reached when JFK ordered a crackdown on the Cuban exile gunboats being run by the CIA out of Miami. The CIA's repeated attempts to entrap the president into launching a US invasion of Cuba, which Douglass documents carefully, had failed yet again.\n\nOf course, JFK was no angel, nor does Douglass present him as such. He made mistakes. Only nine days after his visionary American University address, JFK approved Operation Mongoose, a CIA program of sabotage and harassment against targets in Cuba. This was, as Douglass rightly says, against international law. Douglass suggests Kennedy did this under strain from hawks in his administration demanding increased pressure on Castro to counter Cuba's policy of apparently exporting revolution in Latin America.\n\nOnce we accept that the CIA killed JFK, the point about whether JFK would or would not have pulled out of Vietnam becomes secondary. The CIA killed him--but why? It is wholly implausible that the CIA would kill a president simply to settle a score over his failure to be sufficiently belligerent toward Castro. They would only kill a president if they thought it would make a profound policy difference. And President Kennedy had repeatedly proven himself insufficiently hawkish for the crackpot \"realists\" in the CIA and Pentagon.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1958 Lee Harvey Oswald worked as a radar operator at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan. Here he had a \"crypto\" clearance (higher than \"top secret\") and regularly listened to the U-2 radio communications. Atsugi was the CIA's main operational base in the Far East; many U-2 spy planes departed from this base on their missions over the USSR and China. Oswald, having resigned from the Marines two months earlier, appeared at a US embassy in Moscow in 1959, saying he wanted to renounce his US citizenship and affirming his allegiance to the USSR. He said he would give them all information he had about US radar operations.\n\nWhen the Soviets shot down a U-2 on May 1, 1960, the pilot, the pilot Gary Powers later questioned whether or not his having been shot down might have resulted from information Oswald provided to the Soviets. It was not an unreasonable conjecture, and it underscored the fact that Oswald's giving all the information he had as a Marine radar specialist to the Soviets was a treasonous act, performed at the height of the Cold War.\n\nThis fact is significant, because when Oswald returned to the US Embassy in Moscow a year later, US officials welcomed him back with no questions asked. Not only was he not prosecuted, they gave him a loan to return to the US, and a new passport, 24 hours after he applied. Victor Marchetti, ex-CIA agent and author of the book The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, told Anthony Summers that in 1959 the Office of Naval Intelligence launched a program involving sending approximately three dozen ostensibly disenchanted, poor American youths to the USSR in an attempt find out what communism was all about. Technical eavesdropping was less effective then, and human intelligence was pivotal for intelligence work. Judge James Botelho, Oswald's former roommate in Santa Ana, said Oswald was never a Marxist or Communist. He claimed Oswald's \"defection\" was a US intelligence trick, and that Oswald had been on assignment in Russia for US intelligence.\n\nUpon arriving back from the USSR in 1962, Oswald was met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler's Aid Society, an anti-communist organization with ties to the CIA. With Raikin's help, Oswald, his wife and infant child passed easily through customs and immigration. That summer the Oswalds settled in Fort Worth, Texas. There, George de Mohrenschildt, an oil company consultant and CIA asset, befriended Oswald. De Mohrenschildt admitted in a 1977 interview that he has been given the assignment to meet with Oswald from J. Walton Moore, the Dallas CIA Domestic Contacts Service chief. (47)\n\nDe Mohrenschildt became Oswald's mentor in Dallas, where he helped Oswald secure a new job with a graphic arts company. But De Mohrenschildt likely had little inkling of the convoluted and sinister plot in which he was enmeshed. Years later, in fact, he would express remorse over what had happened to both JFK and Oswald, who were both victims of the same forces.\n\nIn 1963 Oswald moved to New Orleans, where he worked at the Reily Coffee Company, owned by a wealthy supporter of the CIA-sponsored Cuban Revolutionary Council. The company was located near the offices of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service, and Office of Naval Intelligence. Oswald also worked directly across the street from the Naval Intelligence and Secret Service, in the detective agency of former FBI agent Guy Banister. Banister's office was more a covert-action center for US intelligence than a detective agency. It helped supply weapons for CIA covert operations, including the Bay of Pigs and other Cuban-exile attacks on Cuba. Daniel Campbell, an ex-Marine hired by Banister, later admitted that \"Banister was a bagman for the CIA and was running guns to the Alpha 66 (an armed anti-Castro group) in Miami.\" (62)\n\nIt was in New Orleans that Oswald posed as a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, distributing pro-Castro leaflets, apparently intent on drawing attention to himself as a Castro supporter. Oswald would continue to be shepherded and \"mentored\" by various CIA handlers until the assassination of JFK.\n\nIn addition to his documented history as a CIA asset, Oswald was also an FBI informant. Moreover, the evidence suggests that not only was Oswald not a communist, he was a supporter of JFK. Oswald's work with the CIA and the Cuban exiles led him to believe JFK was going to be assassinated. Indeed, there was a plot to kill JFK in Chicago, only twenty days before JFK arrived in Dallas. Douglass cites compelling evidence that it was Oswald himself who tipped off the Chicago police who then arrested the gunmen on the eve of Kennedy's arrival there.\n\nThis book is loaded with creepy details of how this assassination was done: how the autopsy process was taken over by the military; how JFK's cranial x-rays were fraudulently re-made to cover up the documented fact of an entrance wound on his neck and witnesses seeing the back of his skull blown out; how his parade route was changed at the last day, making it more vulnerable to assassins; how fake \"Secret Service\" agents with Secret Service badges thwarted witnesses from pursuing a gunman seen fleeing from the grassy knoll after the shooting; how Jack Ruby was seen by a witness dropping off a gunman in Dealey Plaza at 11 a.m., an hour and a half before the assassination.\n\nTwenty-one out of twenty-two witnesses at Parkland Hospital--most of them doctors and nurses, trained medical observers--agreed in their earliest statements that JFK's massive head wound was located in the right rear of his skull, demonstrating a fatal head shot from the front. They were later pressured by the Warren Commission to recant their statements, making them consistent with the Commission's fabrication of history. Dr. Malcolm Perry repeatedly described a bullet entrance wound in the front of the neck. Yet after being threatened by \"men in suits\" in the Secret Service, he later repudiated his first account as \"inaccurate.\" (308-09)\n\nDouglass's book is not a hagiography of JFK, who was certainly no saint. He was a Cold Warrior; he was a politician. But he was one who, certainly after the Cuban Missile crisis, was turning toward peace and disarmament. And Kennedy was well aware that his moves toward peace--in Indochina as well as with the Soviets, could cost him his life. By the time he went to Dallas, he was certainly aware that he had more to fear from the CIA and hawks in the military industrial complex than he did from the USSR.\n\nThis is a haunting book. It makes it clear that something fundamentally changed with JFK's death. His murder was a coup d'état by the CIA acting on behalf of the military industrial complex. There is extraordinary detail and documentation in this book: it is 410 pages long, with 96 pages of endnotes. Douglass adduces evidence in some cases that did not emerge until after the fall of the Soviet Union, as in the case of the communications between the Kennedy family and the Soviet premier Khrushchev. The correspondence showed that the Kennedy family was well aware that JFK had been killed not by a lone gunman but by \"a right-wing conspiracy.\"\n\nDouglass illustrates how the CIA plot was apparently designed to portray the assassin as a pro-Castro agent, to justify a retaliatory invasion of Cuba and possible nuclear strike against the USSR. But the evidence emerging after the murder revealed too many \"Oswalds\" in too many different places at the same time for that story to be credible. Moreover, it would have been impossible for Oswald to have killed JFK from where he was alleged to have done so.\n\nPresident Johnson faced three choices in response to the assassination: (1) Take what was obviously bogus evidence of a Castro-Soviet connection to the murder and use it to justify an invasion of Cuba and possible hot war against the Soviets; (2) confront the CIA on its falsified documents of Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in the months prior to November 1963, and face a domestic war with the CIA in which it would fight with every covert weapon at its command; or (3) participate in a cover-up of any conspiracy evidence \"and a silent coup d'état that would reverse Kennedy's efforts to end the Cold War. He chose to cover up everything and surrender to Cold War prerogatives.\" (81)\n\nThe FBI is revealed to have been implicated in the cover-up surrounding JFK's assassination, as was the Dallas Police department. What is amazing is how the CIA had so much power to pull this off, but after reading Douglass' careful, meticulous review of the evidence, one has little room to doubt it.\n\nI keep returning to the \"unspeakable\" in the title, and \"why it matters.\" \"Unspeakable\" is a perfect word, because it connotes evil--\"unspeakable evil\"--and at the same time denotes what is forbidden or taboo. It is axiomatic within enlightened circles that there is evil at the heart of the United States. We saw it during the Civil Rights movement in the south, in the lynchings, the cross burnings. We saw it in the Vietnam War. And we saw it in the murder of JFK, certainly. But with the other evils, it was easier to place the locus of responsibility onto an Other. The problem was the southern racists, or the KKK, or the war criminals in the White House. Douglass makes clear, however, that the foe we face is much more formidable foe: it is ourselves, and our denial.\n\nWhat does Douglass mean by the \"unspeakable\"? He means not only those men and institutions who killed JFK, those who dedicate their lives to promoting war and killing over peace and cooperation. Thomas Merton used the term \"unspeakable\" after the murders of JFK, MLK and Robert Kennedy in the 60s, for \"an evil whose depth and deceit...go beyond the capacity of words to describe.\" We might go so far as to say the unspeakable is the existence in the heart of the power structure of the US government, of a Mafia. Indeed, the CIA had an ongoing working relationship with the Mafia at the time of JFK's killing.\n\nRather than define the unspeakable too narrowly, Douglass leaves us with some profound questions: \"What does the nature of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy reveal about ourselves? What does it reveal about a national security state we have allowed to assume control over our lives? Have we reached the point where the state itself has become an enemy of the people, at least until we the people can manage to change, even revolutionize, its purpose? Can we transform our lives, and the state of the United States of America, so as to practice the truth that waging peace is our only real security?\" (374)",

        "comment": "I had just turned 13 the month before the startling news was broadcast into my 8th grade classroom: President John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas and had been rushed to the hospital. It was followed by the bulletin that the President was dead. Lorenzo, my fellow classmate, an Italian Catholic, burst into tears. I sat quietly thinking: at least we got that Papist out of the White House! The anti-Catholic indoctrination I received from my church and parents never allowed me to see JFK as a person, only a symbol of a false religion to reject. Oh, and he was a Democrat as well!\n\nHad I known the JFK that Jim Douglass reveals in his new book, I would have had more reasons to dismiss him: a President engaging in peacemaking activities with the Premier of the godless Communists, Nikita Khrushchev, passing letters back and forth that even members of his Cabinet were unaware! A US President secretly arranging for face-to-face consultations with Fidel Castro to resume normal diplomatic relations with a communist Cuba! The man who issued the secret National Security Action Memorandum 263 ordering the removal of 1,000 US Military advisors from Vietnam by the end of 1963 and ALL US Troops by the end of 1965. Under the guise of \"peacemaking\" President John F. Kennedy was urging \"capitulation\" to the Soviets in the Cold War - at least from my junior high school analysis.\n\nJim Douglass describes JFK's \"turning\" - his movement toward peace rather than \"victory\" after the almost catastrophic \"Cuban Missile Crisis\" the year before in 1962. While the world was on the brink of nuclear devastation, I had practiced the \"duck and cover\" technique at school in the event the Ruskies dropped \"the big one\". My own personal \"turning\" toward peace began five years later when I had to register for the military draft when I turned 18 in the fall of 1968. Fortunately I was no longer dependent on getting political perspective from US News and World Report (The Commies are killing our missionaries in Vietnam!) nor my theology from my evangelical/fundamentalist church (Jesus' call to \"Love your enemies\" was trumped by St. Paul's admonition to the Christians in Rome: \"Let every soul obey the governing authorities\").\n\nHaving been issued a uniform and rifle for the compulsory ROTC class when I registered for my college freshman year, I had an epiphany on the rifle range when I realized that even though the targets were circular, they were, in reality, the bodies of the \"Viet Cong\". Under no reading of Jesus' teaching could I justify pulling the trigger so I registered as a conscientious objector. I had begun my own turning. Little did I know that one year later, I would be marching on the local Wheaton, IL draft board arm-in-arm with a Catholic priest! Another year later would find me taking some courses with that priest at the nearby Catholic Maryknoll Seminary. Soon I would discover Jim Douglass' The Non-Violent Cross after I had left behind my anti-Catholic upbringing and was open to hearing the \"Gospel\" through a new lens. My own turning toward peace.\n\nWhy would a legendary peace theologian get caught up in conspiracy theory? That was my first question when I received an invitation to attend a Pax Christi retreat 5 or 6 years ago led by Jim Douglass. I'd read virtually all his excellent books, followed his campaign against the Trident and the White Train delivering nuclear weapons to those submarines, and had met him at several conferences on peacemaking. When he and his wife Shelly moved to Birmingham to form a Catholic Worker House, I anticipated seeing more of him because I was only four or five hours away in southwest Georgia. However, soon after they arrived, our family moved to Minnesota. Now here was a chance to re-connect with this insightful theologian-activist. But his retreat topic was on the connections between the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers, Martin King and Malcolm X! He talked about how American deals with its prophets - in similar fashion to the way the Romans dealt with the notorious Galilean troublemaker during the administration of Pilate and Felix. At the time, Jim was only beginning the long research project that has led to this first of what promises to be a trilogy of books on the killings of prophets and peacemakers in the 60s in America.\n\nResearch indeed! JFK and the Unspeakable has close to 100 pages of small-print footnotes to document and explain his sources about the JFK most of us did not know. However, a small but powerful force within the government, namely the CIA, the FBI, the Joint Chiefs of the military, and even some of his own Cabinet and advisors, came to feel the need to remove him as a danger to an American strategy of global domination. Kennedy, recognizing that the use of nuclear weapons against the Soviets would leave an estimated 140 million dead, decided you could not \"win\" the Cold War. The others in that military-industrial-intelligence complex felt that with \"only\" a few million Americans killed if America struck with a first-strike, we could \"win\". The window for such an advantage in the nuclear arsenal and delivery systems would narrow and begin to close after 1964, leading some to conclude that the obstacle that the President embodied would have to be removed before the end of 1963.\n\nThe \"unspeakable\" in the title comes from Trappist monk/peacemaker Thomas Merton's book, Raids on the Unspeakable. It is a term he used to describe the confluence of evil within systems like governments, corporations, and other power centers. Walter Wink uses the term \"the Domination System\". St. Paul referred to \"the Principalities and Powers\". President Eisenhower coined the phrase \"the Military Industrial Complex\". Catholic Worker Dorothy Day talked about \"this filthy, rotten system. The \"unspeakable\" that conspired (breathed together) against JFK (and later his brother as well) was the manifestation of the national security state that insisted on total allegiance to both its ideology and methodology. Kennedy ran for office as a Cold Warrior. Only his glimpse into the abyss that was the Cuban Missile Crisis allowed him to see how close that system pushed toward a nuclear holocaust.\n\nKennedy was truly saved by his enemy - Nikita Khrushchev. The irony this book discloses that all three antagonists, Castro, Kennedy, and Khrushchev, all had struggled for peaceful co-existence in opposition to their own advisors. Each leader was trapped within national systems that had a vested interest in keeping the conflict going rather than risking a negotiated resolution.\n\nThrough extensive interviews and research, Douglass paints a compelling portrait of the supposed assassin/\"patsy\", Lee Harvey Oswald. While the Warren Commission (conveniently controlled by ex-CIA Chief, Allen Dulles) failed to interview numerous witnesses that might challenge the \"lone gunman\" theory, Douglass sought out the stories that convincingly (to me) argued for at least one or more \"Oswald\" doubles. Douglass argues that the CIA hoped to pin blame for the assassination of the US President on both Cuba and the Soviets, urging the new President, Lyndon Johnson to \"retaliate\" with their desired preemptive nuclear strike.\n\nIt was the successful cover-up orchestrated by the Warren Commission Report that led to the subsequent assassinations of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, followed by Kennedy's brother, Bobby is the argument Douglass puts forth. JFK and the Unspeakable is the first of a trilogy of books attempting to unmask or at least begin to demystify this force of evil that has so captivated our national soul.\n\nBesides attempting to portray John Kennedy's courage in his \"turning\", Douglass also wants to steel his readers who are committed to peacemaking to be realistic about the challenges we face. If the \"unspeakable\" is willing to kill a sitting President, what should we expect if we attempt to follow Jesus down that same road? The Kennedy that Douglass portrays is less overtly religious than Martin King in his last days (\"I only want to do God's will.\"). JFK \"looked into the abyss\" and chose his path of change or turning when he decided that the fate of the world's children were at stake if these nukes were ever used again. Kennedy realized that even just the atmospheric testing of these weapons imperiled the health of all humanity with the radioactive fallout.\n\nBut Kennedy's religious tradition also spoke to him clearly - especially through the powerful words of the initiator of Vatican II, Pope John XXIII with his final masterpiece, Pacem in Terris. The impact of this work so moved Nikita Khrushchev that he is reported to have kept a medallion given to him by this beloved pontiff on his desk in the Kremlin as a way to irritate some of his own Politburo advisors. Kennedy's own commencement speech given at American University five months before his death certainly owed some of its power and insight to the recently deceased pope who died two weeks prior to that June 1963 address. In that speech which ironically was carried more widely over the radio to Soviet citizens (and ignored by most US media), Kennedy cautioned Americans not to demonize the other side. His words, \"... not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats. No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue.\", could (and should) be readily applied today to Ahmadinejad's Iran.\n\nThe book also raises a very disturbing portrait of how this National Security State imperils our democracy. The idea of a group of secretive men (although there are probably some women in the mix today) deciding who can be or remain President exposes the figure-head nature of the power of that office. The collusion of un-elected agents, military officers, wealthy business elites, \"diplomats\" and others plotting behind the scenes to replace the elected head-of-state is not just something that happens in Third World nations. Was what happened in November 1963 in Dallas really a coup-d'etat?\n\nBack in the mid-70s, William Stringfellow raised questions about the compatibility between democracy and the apparatus of a National Security State. Stringfellow, drawing on the insights of Biblical prophets and the writings of Jewish theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel, called the allegiance demanded of citizens by this obsession with \"security\" during the Cold War by its Biblical name: idolatry. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire, cold warriors searched about for new adversaries so they could continue to justify our dependence on and subservience to the military industrial complex out of fear. Terrorism conveniently became the new whipping boy and the anticipated \"peace dividend\" disappeared.\n\nWhile Douglass' JFK story harkens back to the Cold War, the idolatry of the National Security State is as strong as ever - and its practitioners stand ready to remove or marginalize any who stand in its way. How else could one explain the almost universal condemnation of former-President Jimmy Carter's sit-down with the leadership of Hamas and Syria this Spring? Or the annual rite of genuflecting before the power of AIPAC by both Democrats and Republicans - each vying to out-do the other in pandering to the Israeli state, ignoring and neglecting the cries for justice emanating from behind the 26' tall \"security barrier\", the new Berlin Wall that Carter has identified as apartheid?\n\nThis book is sobering, disturbing -but ultimately hopeful as well. If even such a stout Cold Warrior as John Fitzgerald Kennedy could decide to \"turn toward peace\" -albeit at a terrible price - can we too break the shackles of fear and greed and begin that same turning ourselves? As Jim Douglass reminded a friend of mine: who is the real \"hero\", the prime mover of this story? It is God - God working through JFK, Khrushchev, and others who had the courage to take risks for peace. \"After all,\" Douglass reminded him, \"the nuclear holocaust didn't happen!\"\n\nWe must open ourselves to recognize the common humanity we share, as \"we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's futures. And we are all mortal.\" When we recognize and act on this, we join hands with the Creator and work together to build a world of peace. One place to start is exposing, unmasking, naming the truth behind this system. Exposing it to the light. It might put us in its target but only by escaping its clutches can we truly be free and healed of that primal urge to dominate.",

    "synopsis": "“[A] compelling analysis . . . A solid addition to our understanding of the Vietnam War and a president.” —Publishers Weekly\n \nThe Vietnam War remains a divisive memory for Americans—partisans on all sides still debate why it was fought, how it could have been better fought, and whether it could have been won at all.\n \nIn this major study, a noted expert on the war brings a needed objectivity to these debates by examining dispassionately how and why President Lyndon Johnson and his administration conducted the war as they did. Drawing on a wealth of newly released documents from the LBJ Library, including the Tom Johnson notes from the influential Tuesday Lunch Group, George Herring discusses the concept of limited war and how it affected President Johnson’s decision making, Johnson’s relations with his military commanders, the administration’s pacification program of 1965–1967, the management of public opinion, and the “fighting while negotiating” strategy pursued after the Tet Offensive in 1968.\n\nThis in-depth analysis, from a prize-winning historian and National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, exposes numerous flaws in Johnson’s approach, in a “concise, well-researched account” that “critiques Johnson's management of the Vietnam War in terms of military strategy, diplomacy, and domestic public opinion” (Library Journal).",

        "comment": "George C. Herring argues in his book LBJ and Vietnam: A Different Kind of War, that President Lyndon Johnson horribly mishandled the management of the Vietnam War. Herring contends that Johnson's direction of the war took a back seat to his desire to forward his domestic policies; that his chief advisors were often in conflict with each other for petty reasons, undercutting their effectiveness; that his unwillingness to be frank with his subordinates and the American people caused far more problems that it appeared to solve; and that fundamentally Johnson and his administration were fundamentally unprepared to wage a limited war.\n\nHerring set the stage by offering the context of the Johnson administration's notion of limited war. He noted that the Civil War created an American precedent that war meant mobilizing the country's vast resources to completely destroy the enemy's military power. The American experience in World War I and World War II confirmed and expanded this attitude. With Vietnam, however, the notion of total war gave way to the notion of limited war. This new approach to warfare was born partly from the experience in Korea, and also from the reality of atomic weapons. “The objective would be not to destroy opponents but to persuade them to break off the conflict short of achieving their goals and without resorting to nuclear war” (4). This new form of warfare offered unique strategic disadvantages to the nation. Herring noted that the very idea was more suited to the abstractions of academia than the reality of military engagements. Further, proponents of limited war often argued why their view was correct, but seldom offered practical ways on how such a war would be fought.\n\nHerring cast Johnson as a reluctant wartime president, a leader much more concerned with his domestic agenda that with foreign policy. “He did not want to risk what he later called 'the woman I really loved' (the Great Society) for 'that bitch of a war on the side of the world'” (130). Though Johnson proved a very hands-on leader when it came to the day-to-day management of the war, the president offered no strategic guidance or realistic military/political objectives to his civilian and military officers. While he was involved in picking bombing targets, and had models of battlefields built in the White House situation room, he never directed the war in the manner that Abraham Lincoln or Franklin Roosevelt had. He never clearly defined the mission for the military, and never created firm resource allocation limits for the war.\n\nAnother key factor in Johnson's failure as Commander-in-Chief rest with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Generals were largely politicized, and came from a system that by that time was not producing the kind of military advice the president required, nor did the JCS have any formal place in the chain of command. In 1965, the JCS presented a flawed, though perhaps workable strategy to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara which warned against a slow, gradual buildup of forces in the region with which the North Vietnamese and their allies could keep pace. McNamara dismissed the report out of hand, seeking instead to run the war his own way. “It was never even discussed with the civilian leadership, much less approved or disapproved” (41).\n\nThe Johnson administration was also ill-equipped to exploit peace initiatives. In part, Herring wrote, this was due to the fact that the circumstances surrounding Vietnam were entirely new. He mentions that John Adams dealings with France during the Quasi-War and Lincoln's exploration of peace with Confederate officials are the closest parallels to seeking peace in the Vietnam War, largely because of the roll of unofficial peace feelers and third party interventions. Because of this, and Johnson's prioritizing of other considerations, the administration lost out at a chance for peace when UN Secretary General U Thant approached Washington with an olive branch from the North Vietnamese and their Soviet sponsor. Indeed, in 1964 Johnson was too busy with his election campaign to meet with U Thant. Early the next year, when the secretary reached out again, Johnson rejected it after the U Thant spoke critically of the Johnson administration to the press. Whatever legitimate reasons Johnson may have had for not pursuing the proposals in a timely manner amounted to little when knowledge of the peace feelers became public knowledge. “Washington seemed to be the major obstacle to peaceful settlement of the war” (93).\n\nFor all this, Herring also wrote that Johnson's failures alone cannot fully explain the American failure in Vietnam, and that perhaps no strategic magic bullet could have salvaged the war. Still, Johnson's in ability to offer a clear strategic vision and hard, well-calculated decisions in both the military and political sphere contributed greatly to the American catastrophe in Vietnam.\n\nAndrew J. Rotter, writing in The American Historical Review, offered that Herring's work “has much to commend it.” He particularly noted the sections dealing with Johnson's policies after the Tet Offensive. David M. Barrett's review proved more critical. In The American Political Science Review, he challenged the notions that Johnson provided no clear strategic vision for the war, and that Johnson's advisors rarely achieved a consensus.\n\nHerring's overarching argument that Lyndon Johnson failed to lead during the Vietnam War is entirely convincing. Johnson, a disciple of Roosevelt's New Deal, gave the Great Society pride of place in his administration, while he should have devoted more time and resource to what was obviously amounting to the major foreign policy event of the era. Unlike John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, Johnson's predecessor and successor, Johnson never appreciated the primacy that foreign policy must take for a president of the United States in the Cold War era.\n\nHerring is also correct that many of the problems of the Vietnam War were not directly a fault of Johnson's leadership, because the Vietnam War had no real precedent in American history. One can sympathize somewhat with the policy makers who had to find a way to fight a limited war, a flawed concept from the beginning. Certainly a way had to be found to project American power without touching off a global thermal nuclear war. Still, a president should be able to deal with new challenges and difficulties with determination and intelligence, and surround himself with men able to provide necessary advice and support. Certainly this was true of Lincoln, who met the challenge of the Civil War in such a fashion. As Herring admirably demonstrates, Johnson's management of the Vietnam War was a farce that would be laughable if it weren't so tragic.",

    "synopsis": "Nearly two thousand years after it was written, Meditations remains profoundly relevant for anyone seeking to lead a meaningful life.\n\nFew ancient works have been as influential as the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, philosopher and emperor of Rome (A.D. 161–180). A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, it remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. Marcus’s insights and advice—on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others—have made the Meditations required reading for statesmen and philosophers alike, while generations of ordinary readers have responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. For anyone who struggles to reconcile the demands of leadership with a concern for personal integrity and spiritual well-being, the Meditations remains as relevant now as it was two thousand years ago.\n\nIn Gregory Hays’s new translation—the first in thirty-five years—Marcus’s thoughts speak with a new immediacy. In fresh and unencumbered English, Hays vividly conveys the spareness and compression of the original Greek text. Never before have Marcus’s insights been so directly and powerfully presented.\n\nWith an Introduction that outlines Marcus’s life and career, the essentials of Stoic doctrine, the style and construction of the Meditations, and the work’s ongoing influence, this edition makes it possible to fully rediscover the thoughts of one of the most enlightened and intelligent leaders of any era.",

        "comment": "This review will likely be somewhat different from most of the other comments about this “new” translation of philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius’ classic “Meditations.”\n\nFirst, Wikipedia mentions a dozen different English translations, with Hays’ being written in 2002, so, while well done, it’s not necessarily “today” new.\n\nSecond, the book does a great job of describing Stoicism but doesn’t really get into any validation of the philosophy itself, leaving the reader on his own about the value of Aurelius’ comments about how to live life. Here is some of what the translator/editor says: Stoicism is a concept derived from the Greek for “painted porch,” where the Stoicism-originating philosopher Zeno was said to have taught at the Agora marketplace in ancient Athens. Stoicism is one of the four major schools of philosophic thought established in the Greek period: Stoicism (Zeno), Epicureanism (Epicurus), Cynicism (Diogenes), and Skepticism (Pyrrho). Seneca the Younger, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius are philosophers who continued the stoic tradition into the Roman period. Stoicism says that virtue is the way to achieve eudemonia (\"happiness\" or the highest human good) through an ethical way of life devoted to reason. It provides an emotional resilience to misfortune, especially through its calling much of what happens in life as fate, about which humans can do little, so why complain?\n\nAs for validation, Stoicism has several modern philosophers criticizing it as tantamount to determinism (no free will), a way to avoid trying hard to change the world, and a way to deaden the pain in moments of loss. Yes, there is great truth in the goal of living life according to reason. Still, there is also value in not always suppressing emotions (or psychosomatic responses to previously made value judgments) as psychologists would advise.\n\nIn this respect, I was intrigued by what happened (outside the parameters of Aurelius’ commentary) with his Nero-like son, Commodus. Commodus reigned from 177 (jointly until Aurelius' death in 180) and then another twelve years by himself until his assassination by his wrestling partner in 192 AD at age 31 (at the end of the Pax Romana). Commodus had little interest in administration, leaving it to others who irked Rome's senators by increasing their taxes. He did not continue the frequent warfare known during his father’s reign. While peaceful, Commodus’ rule was known for its abundant intrigues, reversion to dictatorial rule, and creation of his deific personality cult with him fashioned as a new Hercules and/or Romulus. He performed as a gladiator, as loosely portrayed in the movie “Gladiator.” Some historians thought he was not naturally wicked but guileless and brought to his actions through cowardice as a slave to his companions. But was his rejection of Stoicism at least partially the result of his upbringing by Marcus? Consider Marcus’ comment in Book Eleven, #34: “As you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper to yourself, ‘He may be dead in the morning.’” Is this any way to develop a love for one’s son, or is it a way to stifle it in trying to avoid the pain of future loss (so, since I made sure it won’t hurt, just go ahead and sock it to me)?\n\nAs regards the stoic-like “Serenity Prayer” of modern philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr (or his student Winnifred Crane Wygal), consider the pithy challenge to have the wisdom to know the difference between what can and cannot be changed. One will read long and hard throughout Aurelius’ twelve books (many of which dwell upon mortality) of the self-pep-talk “Meditations” to find any sure-fire way to know or even consider the difference. Nevertheless, Aurelius does a great job in commenting on the value of moral character (seeking the truth, deciding what is right, and courageously acting accordingly).\n\nSpeaking of moral character and Stoicism, George Washington is said to have absorbed Stoicism from time spent with his brother’s inlaws, the Fairfaxes of Belvoir. Of special note was Washington’s fascination with the stoic character of the noble Roman Senator Cato the Younger in Addison’s play “Cato, a Tragedy,” about the republican martyr Cato’s contention against the dictator Julius Caesar. There’s also the stoic-like “call of duty” example from the virtuous early Roman consul Cincinnatus. As well, in Washington’s youth, he was said to have owned an English outline copy of the principle dialogues of the stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger.\n\nBottom-line and my commentary aside, Marcus Aurelius’ book in this translation is highly recommended to be read as a classic “Great Book” from one of history’s most notable warrior philosopher-kings.\n\nOf possible interest to those interested in George Washington as a warrior philosopher-definitely-not-wanting-to-be-king, check out the following book detailing the importance of character in securing life, liberty, and the \"pursuit of happiness\": ",

        "comment": "First, the book: it is standard paperback perfectbound. Nothing special, but not exceptionally bad. I believe the hardcover is also perfectbound (they should call it \"lousybound\") instead of sewn; and why would I buy a hardcover, if the binding is not sewn? It won't lay open flat, which makes it even harder to read than a paperback! For $8.00, cheaper than some others, this translation is by far the best on the market.\n\nHays is faithful to the Greek (sometimes overliteral, rarely overfree), more so than other translations. Hays manages to transmit more of the style and mood of Aurelius' actual writing than any other translation by an order of magnitude: this can be a blessing or a curse.\n\nHowever much I demand that my Bibles be literally/formally translated to carry over as much as possible even of the order and form of the God-breathed words (I can't read Hebrew or Aramaic), it's not something I desire in literature, for which, being uninspired (except artistically), the actual words and idioms used generally have no great value, the value instead being in the sense of the text. (I think Hofstadter's Godel Escher Bach is an exception to this, and can't imagine that it can be translated, as so much of the meaning of the book depends on form and peculiarities of the English language.)\n\nSt Jerome had much the same opinion, stating, I believe in an epistle to St Augustine while defending his (debatable) choice of translating his Vulgate from the Jews' modern Hebrew (which had already entered in on the process of eliminating prophecies of Christ, leaving us with gems such as, \"like a lion my hands and feet\", which, with different pointing, reads, \"they have pierced my hands and feet\" - the first one doesn't even make sense!) instead of their ancient Septuagint Greek: \"When translating the sacred scriptures, I attempt to give Greek and Hebrew a clothing of Latin, retaining even the word order so far as it is possible [that is, formal translation: in the process giving rise to \"Ecclesiastical Latin\", as the Vulgate is no more Ciceronian or Virgilian Latin than Spanish is] but when translating the works of men, I endeavor to translate the sense of what is being said, not only the words [that is, dynamic translation]\".\n\nDe Selincourt's translations of Livy are some of the best examples of the latter. Livy is far from inspired: I care little about the form of the words he used, but the sense. De Selicourt's translation has me laughing aloud, much as I imagine the original readers would have, at the constant ineptitude and malice of the tribunes, always pushing for \"agrarian reform\" as a rallying-cry. Ancient historians did not set out to write just a history, but also a work of great literature: mere modern history was accounted unworthy of the pen, and was for the annals of the priests, to be recorded in lists of names, locations, and dates. Names, locations, and dates do not alone a history make: the ancients understood this. That's why ancient history, from Livy to Plutarch*** to Suetonius to Xenophon to Tacitus to Polybius, is uniformly excellent, and why modern history is uniformly bad in comparison. The best of modern history, the transitional and seminal Decline and Fall of Gibbon, is the closest one comes, but it is colored and ruined by a deep hatred of all things clerical, Catholic, and Christian, which absolutely permeates the work, and a subtext of love for the barbaric Mohammedans, whom he viewed as \"rational\" in comparison. At least he got his bias towards the degenerate Byzantine empire and its ossified Orthodox religion right.\n\n***Speaking of Plutarch, one has two choices: the modern and decent translations of Penguin in horrible editions, issued in half a dozen books with many lives overlapping (i.e. Alexander is in two books, Caesar in three) in a series that is still incomplete, with the lives presented out of order and Plutarch's comparisons either omitted entirely or presented after one of the lives mentioned, whereas the life being compared to is not even in the same volume, let alone back to back: or Modern Library's old translation from the 1600s (updated in the 1800s to remove the most archaic verbiage and most of the archaic pronouns) that reads poorly (even worse than Dickens, and I hate Dickens), as a stereotyped \"classic\", but is presented in two volumes in correct order with the comparisons, much as Plutarch intended. One needs both editions, so one can read the Penguin translations in the order given in Modern Library, and then read Modern Library's printing of Plutarch's comparisons of lives. (If one had to choose one or the other, the trade-off for readability in the Penguin is too great, compared to the poor presentation: one should choose the Modern Library.)\n\nThat brings me to the best of the \"truly modern\" historians, Steven Runciman; his work is terrible compared to the ancients, and stellar compared to the rest of the moderns, who are more suited to writing technical specifications or books of law than anything else. Lest anyone think the moderns are more truthful or less biased, Runciman's obsessive fawning over that same decrepit Orthodox religion and overweening sympathy for the degenerate Byzantines (and even a hint of sympathy for those enemies of all civilization, the paynim foe, the Mohammedan, who had encroached on the lands of Christendom for four centuries and were slaughtering and enslaving pilgrims to the Holy Land to attempt to prop up their failing empire by trying to acquire new sources of dhimmis wherever they could be found) should dispel that notion - only sourcing has been improved. But even with bibliographies, one can choose and weight a work towards those extremely biased sources, such as Anna Komnena's report of the Crusade (which Runciman relies heavily upon). Warren Carroll is likely the best historian of our generation, with Jaroslav Pelikan close behind; but Jaroslav Pelikan, unlike Carroll and Toynbee, did not do \"surveys of history\", but focused on a very specific topic. Much as all of the professions, except for the noble philosophers and theologians (and even those, to a degree) have become so cripplingly overspecialized as to be facetious to non-specialists.\n\nSome philosophy (notably Aristotle) requires the translation to be stiff if one is to follow Aristotle's thought, and not the translator's interpretation of his philosophy (much like the Bible), which can never be trusted today. It reminds me of the old Bollingen Plato which I had to use when studying philosophy, before the much better Hackett editions and the new single-volume one were released, where all of the introductions gushed, \"Plato was so smart - almost as smart as we (Hume, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Heidegger) are!\" (blasphemy - Aristotle had more philosophical sense when he grunted to take a shite than Hume did in thirty years of writing ponderous tomes of trash).\n\nFor other translations, \"The Emperor's Handbook\" is lousy, IMO. It's too loose. I cut my teeth on Staniforth's translation, which is archaic, overly flowery, and too loose at the same time. I think the Hammond translation is the second best (after Hays) out there.\n\nI also prefer Hays immensely because he leaves \"logos\" untranslated (instead of translating it as a range of words, improperly injecting interpretation in to the text, as no one option, such as \"reason\", works in all places in the Meditations), and, reading the book as a Catholic, I am often amazed at the insights towards Christ (the Logos) that are revealed in the jarring disconnect between the English translation and the transliteration of \"logos\" - I often think that Emperor Marcus Aurelius was writing about Christ; whether by accident of language, coincidence of Hellenistic philosophy, divine inspiration, or because the Christian ethos had already so permeated the Empire by the time of the writing of the Meditations, I know not. Nevertheless, Hays' translation can be used in places nearly as a Christian devotional instead of reading like Enlightenment garbage crossed with paleo-paganism and new ageism, as the Staniforth translation reads (always capitalizing \"Reason\", \"the Whole [as in, 'return to \"the Whole\" at death']\"). When reading Greek philosophy, \"logos\" is such a common word it loses its power and distinction as essentially the Incarnate Word, appearing constantly in contexts where Christ never would because of the nature of truth, being seen as in a mirror darkly - not so in the Meditations, this translation has shown, wherever \"logos\" is, one can insert \"the Logos\" and get an even greater sense of Aurelius' text - I am tempted to say a sensius plenor.",

        "comment": "a profound journey into the mind of Marcus Aurelius, and this translation makes his ancient wisdom feel strikingly modern and relevant. Gregory Hays' meticulous work brings the Stoic philosophy of Aurelius to life in a way that resonates deeply with readers today. The book is a treasure trove of insights, presenting a timeless guide to navigating life's challenges with grace and resilience. Aurelius' introspective musings on self-discipline, perspective, and the impermanence of life are as applicable now as they were in his time. Hays' translation captures the essence of the original text while making it accessible and understandable to contemporary readers. Whether you're a philosophy enthusiast or simply seeking guidance for a more meaningful life, this translation of Meditations is an indispensable companion. It's not just a book; it's a transformative journey into the mind of one of history's greatest thinkers.",

        "comment": "The information in this book has awakened me to some recent developments of concern, of which I've been only vaguely aware.\n\nMen Who Hate Women details the curent trend of increasing online radicalization and the ways in which this is not only becoming more extreme but more normalized. It makes for difficult but important reading.\n\nFor some time now, I have been aware of opinions coming from younger generations to the general effect that all or most of the major concerns of the 1960s and '70s -- among them reproductive freedom -- have been resolved, so that, although many still identified as \"feminists,\" many others vocally rejected or were not interested -- ie, \"problem solved,\" ERA defeated, and movement shelved.\n\nWe see today, women voting in local and national governmental elections, I'd call it against their own interests, to put, and keep, women and men in positions of power over them who are anti-woman.\n\nAnd we see the rise of the kind of woman-hating so well described by this book, not only in online groups but in national media and on social media, YouTube being one example the author details.\n\nThis situation harms both genders; and children too young to be able to evaluate this trend from experience are drawn into it.\n\nCan we do anything? To address any challenge, learning as much as possible about it is a good first step.\n\nTherefore, on the general subject of misogyny and subjection, here are two excellent classic books, both deep dives, both by men, that I'd like to recommend:\n\nMisogyny - The World's Oldest Prejudice by Jack Holland\nThe Subjection of Women by John Stuart Mill\n\nI also recommend a newer book with a premise that is gaining in influence, and research to back it up, that explains anger, but may add some additional insight to the misogyny phenomenon:\n\nAnger by Carol Tavris\n\nMisogyny has deep roots. It has to do with history, socialization, cultural norms and more. But as to the norms, how did they develop and what purpose do they serve?\n\nConsider that both genders, well into old age typically continue believing certain things, long after they have had many opportunities to reconsider earlier learnings. Reconsidering is often done on a selective basis ... thus we could ask which ideas are most resistant to change and why.\n\nI think Tavris helps answer this, and her book would be additional valuable reading, especially for authors on the related subject of misogyny.\n\nPros:\nI'd recommend this book for people who would like information on what is happening with the men's movement(s), and who are able to handle some pretty harsh realities.\n\nCons:\nSome will find the information a bit overwhelming.",

It is a frightening reminder of the power of online extremist communities to radicalize and manipulate individuals, and the urgent need to address and combat this issue.\n\nBates also does an excellent job of showing how this ideology has infiltrated mainstream media, our everyday lives, and even our government. The book is both fascinating and horrifying, and serves as a wake-up call to the deep-seated issues of loathing and anti-feminism that continue to plague our society.

    "synopsis": "AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\n\"Provocative and appealing . . . well worth your extremely limited time.\" —Barbara Spindel, The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe average human lifespan is absurdly, insultingly brief. Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks.\n\nNobody needs telling there isn’t enough time. We’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and “life hacks” to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks.\n\nDrawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern fixation on “getting everything done,” Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as individuals and as a society—and that we could do things differently.",

        "comment": "As a devoted productivity geek, I immediately got on the waitlist for a Kindle copy at my library. Once I finally got it, I was delighted.\n\nThe real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.\n\nThe premise of Four Thousand Weeks is that an average person lives for only four thousand weeks. What will you do with that time? All of human history has taken approximately 310,000 weeks. We are but a blip, and knowing this, Burkeman asks the reader, how will you get everything done?\n\nWe don’t. Plain and simple.\n\nArguably, time management is all life is. Yet the modern discipline known as time management—like its hipper cousin, productivity—is a depressingly narrow-minded affair, focused on how to crank through as many work tasks as possible, or on devising the perfect morning routine, or on cooking all your dinners for the week in one big batch on Sundays.\n\nBurkeman advocates not for Pomodoro techniques, bullet journals, and habit trackers but for actively choosing what you won’t do. He explains how we strive for things like Inbox Zero or crossing things off our to-do lists only for more things to find their way into our email and onto our lists. The key, Burkeman shares, is not eschewing stuff you don’t want to do in favor of what you do want to do but choosing what matters most for your time of all the things you do want to do. For example, you may not want to go to your upcoming reunion, so saying no to that event in favor of going on a vacation might be easy. We must genuinely manage our time when we want to spend time with our partner, write a book, learn to ski, adopt a pet, decorate cakes, and take a vacation. It’s much more challenging to choose what you won’t do when you genuinely want to do the things on your list.\n\nThe day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control—when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do lists have stopped getting longer; when you’re meeting all your obligations at work and in your home life; when nobody’s angry with you for missing a deadline or dropping the ball; and when the fully optimized person you’ve become can turn, at long last, to the things life is really supposed to be about. Let’s start by admitting defeat: none of this is ever going to happen.\n\nThere are dozens of great quotes throughout Four Thousand Weeks. I love the thought that you can only have three things or projects going on at any given time. To take on a new project, you must finish or quit one of your other three. I also appreciated how Burkeman addresses side hustle culture and burnout culture, which seems prevalent in the millennial generation (hi! That’s me!).\n\n…it’s now common to encounter reports, especially from younger adults, of an all-encompassing, bone-deep burnout, characterized by an inability to complete basic daily chores—the paralyzing exhaustion of “a generation of finely honed tools, crafted from embryos to be lean, mean production machines,” in the words of the millennial social critic Malcolm Harris.\n\nHe also describes hobbies as critical, but it’s okay if you feel silly talking about them with others because you do them out of pure enjoyment – not with the goal you might one day monetize it.\n\nWhen an activity can’t be added to the running tally of billable hours, it begins to feel like an indulgence one can’t afford. There may be more of this ethos in most of us—even the nonlawyers—than we’d care to admit.\n\nFour Thousand Weeks is the book everyone must read to get over hustle culture and project mindsets. Sometimes the purpose of life is to enjoy existing.\n\nThe world is bursting with wonder, and yet it’s the rare productivity guru who seems to have considered the possibility that the ultimate point of all our frenetic doing might be to experience more of that wonder.\n\nI instantly loved this book, and it will sit at the top of my recommendations for quite some time.",

It’s heavily researched and referenced, with 13 notes pages and 8 pages of index.\n\nHe does this via many stories, history, and examples in dense sentences. It can be funny, engaging, and at times tedious.\n\nThe gist is “Finitude.” We have limited time. Four Thousand weeks if you live to be 80 years old. His premise is that to become empowered; you must accept the limitations and lack of control over your life. . You accomplish more of what matters and is meaningful to you. The book ends with ten tools to help you embrace your Finitude. The rest of the book is a journey to prove it, entertain you, and inspire you.\n\nThis is his journey and justification for his life. Much of it I can relate to. I, too, was a productivity junkie and taught project management. I found some places where I disagreed or didn’t have the challenges he had to overcome or differently. I was mentally arguing with him as I was reading. He comes across as a bit of an intellectual snob to me. He doesn’t seem to like “self-help,” yet this is what the book is about. He uses romance novelist Danielle Steele as an unhealthy example of time management and Rod Stewart as a good example. There are long winding sentences. There were a few words I had to look up the meaning.\n\nI used this book for a book group, and there is something for everyone in this book.",

The most compelling account of King’s life in a generation.” —Mark Whitaker, The Washington Post\n\n“No book could be more timely than Jonathan Eig’s sweeping and majestic new King . . . Eig has created 2023′s most vital tome.” —Will Bunch, The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nHailed by The New York Times as “the new definitive biography,” King mixes revelatory new research with accessible storytelling to offer an MLK for our times.\n\nVividly written and exhaustively researched, Jonathan Eig’s King: A Life is the first major biography in decades of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.—and the first to include recently declassified FBI files. In this revelatory new portrait of the preacher and activist who shook the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an intimate view of the courageous and often emotionally troubled human being who demanded peaceful protest for his movement but was rarely at peace with himself. He casts fresh light on the King family’s origins as well as MLK’s complex relationships with his wife, father, and fellow activists. King reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. As he follows MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast American race relations and became our only modern-day founding father—as well as the nation’s most mourned martyr.\n\nIn this landmark biography, Eig gives us an MLK for our times: a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, and a committed radical who led one of history’s greatest movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime.\n\nIncludes 8 pages of black-and-white photographs",

        "comment": "King: A Life by Jonathan Eig is a comprehensive and meticulously researched biography delving into the life and achievements of Martin Luther King Jr., the eminent leader of the American civil rights movement. Eig’s work draws upon extensive sources, including recently declassified FBI files, to construct a multifaceted and intricate portrayal of King as a man of remarkable moral fortitude and political acumen. Nevertheless, the author does not avoid examining King’s imperfections, such as his struggles with infidelity and depression, thereby humanizing the iconic figure.\n\nEig commences the book by illuminating King’s formative years in Atlanta, Georgia, where he grew up in a middle-class family and received an education within the confines of the city’s segregated school system. Despite these adversities, King exhibited exceptional intellectual prowess and innate leadership qualities, rapidly ascending the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) ranks, the organization he spearheaded during the apex of the civil rights movement.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Eig chronicles King’s seminal moments, encompassing the Montgomery bus boycott, the March on Washington, and the Birmingham campaign. Moreover, he delves into lesser-known accounts of King’s clandestine endeavors, such as his arduous efforts to mobilize black voters in the South and his vociferous opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nThe author confronts King’s shortcomings head-on, acknowledging his extramarital affairs and battles with depression. But, conversely, Eig contends that these personal failings did not detract from King’s unwavering dedication to the cause of civil rights. Instead, he argues that these flaws endowed King with relatability and enhanced his leadership efficacy.\n\nKing: A Life is an exemplary biography that proffers a novel and incisive perspective on one of the most influential figures in American history. Jonathan Eig’s opus is indispensable for those seeking a comprehensive understanding of the civil rights movement and the enduring legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. Eig adeptly interweaves King’s personal life and public activism, deftly demonstrating how his faith, family, and friendships contributed to his unwavering commitment to the cause of civil rights. He conscientiously situates King within the broader historical context, elucidating the profound impact of other civil rights luminaries, such as Rosa Parks and Malcolm X, on King’s trajectory while underscoring his reciprocal influence on the civil rights movement.\n\nDespite its considerable length, King: A Life remains captivating throughout, as Eig narrates King’s story with both eloquence and fervor. The book is enriched by a wealth of meticulously researched details that will engage scholars and general readers alike. King: A Life is a masterful biography poised to attain classic status. It is an essential read for those seeking profound insights into the civil rights movement and the lasting imprint of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nJonathan Eig’s presentation of evidence is meticulous and compelling. Drawing from FBI files, he illuminates the extensive surveillance endured by King under the auspices of the federal government. Moreover, he substantiates King’s struggles with infidelity and depression through direct quotations from King’s papers. Moreover, Eig supplements his research with interviews of King’s acquaintances, kin, and colleagues, providing a comprehensive panorama of King’s life and accomplishments.\n\nJonathan Eig’s comprehensive research and articulate presentation of his findings attest to his expertise in the subject matter. He deftly identifies the pivotal themes in King’s life and work, offering nuanced interpretations of his enduring legacy. Consequently, King: A Life serves as a valuable resource for those desiring a more profound understanding, constituting a thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating read.\n\nThere is something more here, of course. Jonathan Eig has written a remembrance and reminder of how democracy in America is ever evolving into a more perfect union. And that our history matters in this evolution. Our nation’s past impacts who we are today and tomorrow.\n\nContemporary America is currently witnessing the emerging presence of radicalized conservative political forces endeavoring to redefine our historical narrative and reconstruct our national identity. The emergence of anti-woke, anti-intellectual, illiberal, autocratic, authoritarian, and anti-democratic movements and trends within American society poses significant threats to the nation's progress and our national security.\n\nThese radicalized movements impede our ability to reach our utmost human potential and undermine the exceptionalism of the United States and its global leadership. To counteract this trajectory, it is imperative that we retain a collective understanding of our identity as a people and acknowledge the immense strides we have made throughout our history. Drawing inspiration from John Winthrop's vision, we must strive to become the beacon of hope, a metaphorical “shining city upon a hill” that other nations aspire to emulate.\n\nA SAINT JULIAN PRESS, Inc. – Book Review © 2023\nWritten by Publisher/CEO/Executive Editor – Ron Starbuck",

        "comment": "I purchased this book several months ago and finally got around to pioneering my way through the 557 pages of text. Author Jonathan Eig has done an extraordinary job in covering the life of Martin Luther King warts and all. It was probably at Morehouse College that triggered King's attitude of \"refusing to cooperate with an evil system\" and becoming more interested in serving than in making money.\n\nI found it interesting that Rosa Parks, at least verbally in relating her reason for not taking a back seat on a Birmingham bus on December 1, 1955, gave as her reason as being tired and no mention was made regarding her thinking of Emmett Till who was murdered in August of 1955. Whether she thought of him at that time would be another matter. That successful boycott lasted for 371 days.`\n\nKing was certainly committed in seeking equal rights for Negroes as he felt a still small voice telling him to \"stand up for what's right and I will be with you always\" even as he faced numerous arrests and a stabbing by a deranged woman at a book signing in New York. I wasn't aware that the letter he wrote from a jail cell in Birmingham was written on napkins, toilet paper, and greasy sandwich paper and later pieced together in meaningful prose.\n\nThe 1950s are looked upon very nostalgically by people but not so for our Black brothers and sisters and the 1960s exploded with conflict and violence which is amply covered by the author with the lunch counter sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, and other cities along with Alabama Governor George Wallace standing in the doorway to prevent two Black students from entering the school. Four Black little girls were murdered in church in a bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in addition to attack dogs and fire hoses being used on protesters. Assassinations of Medgar Evers, President Kennedy, Malcom X, Bobby Kennedy, and finally King himself took place during this decade. Author Eig covers them all in addition to the roles played by Birmingham police commissioner Bull Connor, J. Edgar Hoover of the F.B.I., President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the feuds between Johnson verses Bobby Kennedy and Hoover verses King.\n\nAuthor Eig covers King's 1963 I Have A Dream speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial very well along with the details that it entailed. He also covers the adulteries that King was involved in that Hoover wanted to ensnare him in through bugging his phone or hotel room at the Willard Hotel in Washington.\n\nApparently it was Governor George Wallace standing defiantly in the doorway to prevent two Black students from entering that triggered President Kennedy to get a Civil Rights bill passed which took place under President Johnson in 1964 following Kennedy's death with the Voting Rights Bill passing in 1965 when Johnson declared,. \"I've lost the south for a generation.\" The Republican party has now replaced the Democratic party as the party of choice in the southern states.\n\nThis book has been a mammoth undertaking by author Jonathan Eig but I found it to be a relatively easy read despite its length. I read the first 200 pages in one sitting with a brief break for lunch. I felt as though I was reliving through these tumultuous years all over again. The book contains 16 pages of photographs.",

        "comment": "Is said that poetry is the way in which words, like ancient magic, transmits a precise knowledge, a truth, in such a way that symbol and meaning are almost the same. This work by Sun Tzu feels like poetry as it goes to the essence of the human being as a creature that attempts enterprises. Sun Tzu has bequeathed us a short book that is classical in the sense that its immortality is confirmed by the fact that it doesn't matter in which century you read it, it is not outdated. Is universal because it doesn't matter your race, gender, occupation or beliefs: \"The Art of War\" is illuminating. It lights up deep truths about the way we have to behave in order to win. It is a fundamental reading, the sooner you read it the better : )\n\nAmazonClassics Edition are the best for works written in English language. They offer the text in its purity, with X-Ray and excellent formatting. Sadly for their books written in another languages they rely on translations already in the public domain. This means that is a question of luck to have a good translation, in the case of \"The Art of War\" the problem is that the translator, Lionel Giles, gives a poorly organized introduction with duplicate and, to be blunt, boring data. Fortunately afterwards he has the good taste to put the text pure without commentary. It is a good translation with few outdated words. But it adds then the same text with a commentary that is pointless, only an exercise of vanity, because it explains what is already crystal clear, save a couple of data all is, for our century, already outdated. I'd love if Amazon would allow us to delete pages and chapters so this perfect book could not be mutilated with unnecessary additions. For this book I think the AmazonClassics Edition, despite its good presentation, is not the best one.",

        "comment": "Jordan Peterson is a beacon of light in this chaotic world, a psychologist whose writing combines science and common sense. One of his talents is his ability to articulate complex ideas to a wide audience. Regardless of whether you have a background in psychology or not, you will understand this book. It covers his twelve rules for life, which are intended not only as a guide for life of the individual, but as a remedy for society’s present ills. Peterson believes that the cure for society starts with curing the individual, the smallest unit of society. Peterson’s well-known advice to clean your room is a reflection of the truth that if you can’t even manage the most basic and mundane responsibilities of life, then you have no business dictating to others how to fix society.\n\nOne of the main themes of this book is: Personal change is possible. There's no doubt you can be slightly better today than you were yesterday. Because of Pareto's Principle (small changes can have disproportionately large results), this movement towards the good increases massively, and this upward trajectory can take your life out of hell more rapidly than you could believe. Life is tragic and full of suffering and malevolence. But there's something you can start putting right, and we can't imagine what good things are in store for us if we just fix the things that are within our power to do so.\n\nThe 12 Rules for Life:\n\nIn Peterson’s own words, it’s 12 rules to stop you from being pathetic, written from the perspective of someone who himself tried to stop being pathetic and is still working on it. Peterson is open about his struggles and shortcomings, unlike many authors who only reveal a carefully curated façade.\n\nRule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back. People have bad posture, and the meaning behind it can be demonstrated by animal behaviors. Peterson uses the example of the lobster. When a lobster loses a fight, and they fight all the time, it scrunches up a little. Lobsters run on serotonin and when he loses, levels go down, and when he wins, levels go up and he stretches out and is confident. Who cares? We evolutionarily diverged from lobsters 350 million years ago, but it’s still the same circuit. It’s a deep instinct to size others up when looking at them to see where they fit in the social hierarchy. If your serotonin levels fall, you get depressed and crunch forward and you’re inviting more oppression from predator personalities and can get stuck in a loop. Fixing our posture is part of the psycho-physiological loop that can help you get started back up again.\n\nRule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. People often have self-contempt whether they realize it or not. Imagine someone you love and treat well. You need to treat yourself with the same respect. Take care of yourself, your room, your things, and have respect for yourself as if you’re a person with potential and is important to the people around you. If you make a pattern of bad mistakes, your life gets worse, not just for you, but for the people around you. All your actions echo in ways that cannot be imagined. Think of Stalin’s mother and the mistakes she made in life, and how the ripple effects went on to affect the millions of people around him.\n\nRule 3: Choose your friends carefully. It is appropriate for you to evaluate your social surroundings and eliminate those who are hurting you. You have no ethical obligation to associate with people who are making your life worse. In fact, you are obligated to disassociate with people who are trying to destroy the structure of being, your being, society’s being. It’s not cruel, it’s sending a message that some behaviors are not to be tolerated.\n\nRule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. You need to improve, and you may even be in real bad shape, but many unfairly compare themselves to some more seemingly successful person. Up till around age 17, random comparisons to other people can make sense, but afterwards, especially age 30+, our lives become so idiosyncratic that comparisons with others become meaningless and unhelpful. You only see a slice of their life, a public facet, and are blind to the problems they conceal.\n\nRule 5: Don't let children do things that make you dislike them. You aren't as nice as you think, and you will unconsciously take revenge on them. You are massively more powerful than your children, and have the ability and subconscious proclivity for tyranny deeply rooted within you.If you don't think this is true, you don't know yourself well enough. His advice on disciplinary procedure: (1) limit the rules. (2) use minimum necessary force and (3) parents should come in pairs.It's difficult and exhausting to raise children, and it's easy to make mistakes. A bad day at work, fatigue, hunger, stress, etc, can make you unreasonable.\n\nRule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. Life is tragic and there's malevolence. There's plenty to complain about, but if you dwell on it, you will become bitter and tread down a path that will take you to twisted places. The diaries of the Columbine killers are a chilling look into minds that dwelled on the unholy trinity of deceit, arrogance, and resentment) . So instead of cursing the tragedy that is life, transform into something meaningful. Start by stop doing something, anything, that you know to be wrong. Everyday you have choices in front of you. Stop doing and saying things that make you weak and ashamed. Do only those things that you would proudly talk about in public.\n\nRule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient). Meaning is how you protect yourself against the suffering that life entails. This means that despite the fact that we’re all emotionally wounded by life, we’ve found something that makes it all worthwhile. Meaning, Peterson says, is like an instinct, or a form of vision. It lets you know when you’re in the right place, and he says that the right place is midway between chaos and order. If you stay firmly ensconced within order, things you understand, then you can’t grow. If you stay within chaos, then you’re lost. Expediency is what you do to get yourself out of trouble here and now, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing the future for the present. So instead of doing what gets you off the hook today, aim high. Look around you and see what you can make better. Make it better. As you gain knowledge, consciously remain humble and avoid arrogance that can stealthily creep on you. Peterson also says to be aware of our shortcomings, whatever they may be; our secret resentments, hatred, cowardice, and other failings. Be slow to accuse others because we too conceal malevolent impulses, and certainly before we attempt to fix the world.\n\nRule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie. Telling the truth can be hard in the sense that it’s often difficult to know the truth. However, we can know when we’re lying. Telling lies makes you weak. You can feel it, and others can sense it too. Meaning, according to Peterson, is associated with truth, and lying is the antithesis of meaning. Lying disassociates you with meaning, and thus reality itself. You might get away with lying for a short while, but only a short time. In Peterson’s words “It was the great and the small lies of the Nazi and Communist states that produced the deaths of millions of people.”\n\nRule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't. A good conversation consists of you coming out wiser than you went into it. An example is when you get into an argument with your significant other, you want to win, especially if you get angry. If you’re more verbally fluent than the other person then you can win. One problem is that the other person might see something better than you, but they can’t quite articulate it as well. Always listen because there’s a possibility they’re going to tell you something that will prevent you from running headfirst into a brick wall. This is why Peterson says to listen to your enemies. They will lie about you, but they will also say true things about yourself that your friends won’t. Separate the wheat from the chaff and make your life better.\n\nRule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech: There is some integral connection between communication and reality (or structures of belief as he likes to say). Language takes chaos and makes it into a ‘thing.’ As an example, imagine going through a rough patch in your life where you can’t quite put your finger on what’s wrong. This mysterious thing that’s bothering you—is it real? Yes, if it’s manifesting itself as physical discomfort. Then you talk about it and give it a name, and then this fuzzy, abstract thing turns into a specific thing. Once named, you can now do something about it. The unnameable is far more terrifying than the nameable. As an example, the movie the Blair Witch project didn’t actually name or describe the evil. Nothing happens in the movie, it’s all about the unnameable. If you can’t name something, it means it’s so terrifying to you that you can’t even think about it, and that makes you weaker. This is why Peterson is such a free speech advocate. He wants to bring things out of the realm of the unspeakable. Words have a creative power and you don’t want to create more mark and darkness by imprecise speech.\n\nRule 11: Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding. This is mainly about masculinity. Peterson remembers seeing children doing all kinds of crazy stunts on skateboards and handrails, and believes this is an essential ingredient to develop masculinity, to try to develop competence and face danger. Jordan Peterson considers the act of sliding down a handrail to be brave and perhaps stupid as well, but overall positive. A lot of rebellious behavior in school is often called ‘toxic masculinity,’ but Peterson would say to let them be. An example would be a figure skater that makes a 9.9 on her performance, essentially perfect. Then the next skater that follows her seems to have no hope. But she pushes herself closer to chaos, beyond her competence, and when successful, inspires awe. Judges award her 10’s. She’s gone beyond perfection into the unknown and ennobled herself as well as humanity as well.\n\nRule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street. This chapter is mainly autobiographical and he writes about tragedy and pain. When tragic things are in front of you and you’re somewhat powerless, you must keep your eyes open for little opportunities that highlight the redemptive elements of life that make it all worthwhile. The title of this chapter comes from his experience of observing a local stray cat, and watching it adapt to the rough circumstances around it. Another thing you must do when life is going to pieces is to shorten your temporal horizon. Instead of thinking in months, you maybe think in hours or minutes instead. You try to just have the best next minute or hour that you can. You shrink the time frame until you can handle it, this is how you adjust to the catastrophe. You try to stay on your feet and think. Although this chapters deals about harsh things, it’s an overall positive one. Always look for what’s meaningful and soul-sustaining even when you’re where you’d rather not be.",

        "comment": "I took about a month to finish Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, in part because I wanted to slow down and try some of the advice in my life.\n\n12 Rules for Life is an interesting book. Equal parts philosophy, psychology, and self-help book, it covers a broad range of topics, with Peterson drawing from life experiences, religion, and history to build a strong case for his points and provide what seems on its surface to be very good advice for people.\n\nThis is where Peterson's background as a clinical psychologist comes in handy. 12 Rules for Life is billed as an \"antidote to chaos\", and that is what its primary focus is. It's not great at helping you be more successful if you're disciplined and self-reliant already. As someone who always struggled with grasping the world, however, I found it very helpful.\n\nSince I started reading this book, I lost 12 pounds, went from writing five hundred words a day to three thousand words a day, started waking up earlier in the morning consistently, and have been much happier.\n\nSome of that is attributable to the fact that I was already willing to make changes, and many of the things I was doing were obviously bad ideas.\n\nBut there is something to be said for the lessons Peterson teaches. They are complicated, sometimes a little indirect, and mired in allegory. This makes them more valuable, if anything. Peterson doesn't use a magic formula, he uses principles of right action. This book provides general ideas and positions that can serve as a great tool to understanding how people think and why things go wrong.\n\nNot everyone will agree with it. There is a chapter in the book where Peterson reflects on the fact that he has opportunities with clients where he could tell them one thing or another and their minds would make it to be total truth either way.\n\nPerhaps that is what Peterson has done here: perhaps most systems like this are sufficient to improve lives if brought diligently into practice.\n\nOr perhaps there is something to Peterson's words. His indictment of meaninglessness and his calls to purpose echo soundly throughout the book. There have been those who say that Peterson's calls for people to get themselves organized and his oft-mystical language is a cover for something sinister.\n\nBut I don't think they've ever really listened to him.\n\nApproaching Peterson a skeptic, I was not sure that reading a book would have the power to change anything in my life. The first few chapters were met with nods, hesitancy, and the concession of points that sounded good. I wasn't hostile to him, and I found many of his points quite clever.\n\nBut when Peterson delved deeper into the archetypes and depth psychology I became suspicious. I had a moderate distrust of the Jungian method; I use it to teach literature, but I did not believe in using archetypes to assess personality.\n\nPeterson's point is that we are all part of something great and interconnected. Because it is so massive, we need to be working to make sense of it. It won't happen automatically, and if we go for an easy explanation we may find ourselves walking dark, treacherous paths of misanthropy and rejection.\n\nWe are complicated pieces in an even more complicated puzzle. Peterson's approach is one of self improvement. When we take steps to sort ourselves out, we also need to enter a symbiotic process of bringing order to our world.\n\nThe purpose of this is not to achieve some sort of superiority. It is to achieve survival. The world will change, and we will be forced to adapt.\n\nPeterson states that \"life is tragic.\" His point is that people need to be ready to deal with adversity. Anyone can handle good times, because that's what we are able to rest and relax during. The true test of a person comes when they lose a loved one or a job or their health. They need to make a decision: what will they do in response.\n\nPeterson uses haunting examples to illustrate what happens when this goes wrong. Using everything from Dostoevsky to the Soviet Union (and countless other insights from modern and historical figures), he creates case studies of what happens when things go wrong and people turn to dysfunction rather than improving their situation.\n\nHis 12 Rules serve as a guide on how to go from that point of failure to a point of redemption, offering a series of suggestions and guidelines to take a life that is becoming corrupted by hatred of the world and everything in it and turn it into a vessel for growth and self-improvement.\n\nIs it a perfect guide to living life? No.\n\nIs it helpful? Does it give insight to great truths? Yes.",

They never understood why…until they uncovered the secret that had haunted their childhood.\n\nBouncing between their Chicago home and the city’s children’s hospital, Pidgeon weathered a series of traumatic surgeries, fabrications, and misdirections. It wasn’t until college that Pidgeon pieced together the puzzle of their identity: they’d been born intersex but raised as a girl, their life shaped by lies that left them physically and mentally scarred. But for Pidgeon, what began as a shameful and traumatic discovery transforms into a painful yet joyous journey of self-love, truth, and healing.\n\nPidgeon’s inspiring memoir is for everyone whose body and spirit defy expectations, a fierce challenge to a system hell-bent on enforcing binary definitions. Ultimately, it’s a celebration of the freedom and empowerment that come from learning the truth about who you are—and living it.",

The pain, the love, the stories of each character, the sheer terror, the survival....the FIGHT in all of the characters is just beyond compare.\nThese two books are just breathtaking.\nI want to go into more detail like I usually do in these reviews but I just finished this book 5 minutes ago and I am just taking it all in and feel like I'm grieving major losses of friends that I loved while simultaneously celebrating the triumphs of the ones who made it through. When an author can connect you to their characters like that, like you know them, that's how you know they are an amazing, talented writer.\nI hope we have not seen the last of Rainey and some of the others and I really look forward to the next book Paige puts out. I will be impatiently waiting lol And probably starting the home street home series all over again in the meanwhile.\n50 STARS. READ THESE BOOKS!!!!!",

    "synopsis": "This hard-hitting book is the definitive account of the Biden administration's most disgraceful hour—and the chaos it unleashed in the world.\n\nAmerica’s chaotic retreat from Afghanistan in 2021 was nothing short of a horror show. Women and children were trampled to death outside the gates of the Kabul airfield. Desperate Afghans fell from the landing gear of departing planes. Taliban fighters mercilessly whipped and humiliated U.S. civilians trying to access the few square miles still controlled by American forces. Countless Afghan interpreters were abandoned to the mercy of the Taliban after risking their lives alongside American troops for years. And thirteen U.S. service members—eleven of whom were still in preschool on 9/11—were murdered in an ISIS suicide bombing that could easily have been prevented.\n \nStill, the full story is worse than anyone imagined. Drawing from hundreds of hours of first-person interviews, investigative reporter Jerry Dunleavy and former Army Captain and Afghanistan veteran James Hasson provide an exclusive, no-holds-barred account of the disastrous events of August 2021. Kabul is packed with shocking and infuriating exclusive details about fatal politics and bureaucracy that contributed to the catastrophe. The authors also tell, for the first time, inspiring stories of the bravery and sacrifices exhibited by countless Americans on the ground.\n \nKabul's original reporting includes eyewitness accounts from servicemembers of all ranks who participated the rescue effort, inside information from senior intelligence officials, interviews with high-ranking members of allied governments, harrowing stories from Americans and Afghan allies willfully abandoned by craven officials in Washington, and exclusive details about veteran-led rescue missions that continue to this day. Chapter after chapter, Kabul depicts American government at its worst and “ordinary” Americans at their best.\n \nUltimately, this book explains how Biden’s Afghanistan retreat spurred a dangerous new era that persist for decades. While Americans watched the fall of Afghanistan with disbelief, our nation’s enemies were also paying close attention.",

Not only did 13 American service men and women lose their lives, countless Americans and Afghan allies were left behind, and we may never know what happened to them. \"Kabul\" is filled with eyewitness accounts, interviews with high-ranking officials and the horrible truth of what really happened. We don't hear much about this event any more, but we can't let it or the heroes who worked so hard for so long be forgotten. I can't say it was an enjoyable read. Most of it angered me.

    "synopsis": "A New York Times bestseller and enduring classic, All About Love is the acclaimed first volume in feminist icon bell hooks' \"Love Song to the Nation\" trilogy.  All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces.\n\n“The word ‘love’ is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,” writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society’s failure to provide a model for learning to love. \n\nAs bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question “What is love?” her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the “100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.” All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.",

I know what love is, so why bother?\n\nBut I'm glad I took the chance to read this book. Bell Hooks is marvelous with her words. I thought my feelings couldn't be put into words, but I was seeing them on the pages staring back at me.\nI'm partly angry because I didn't grow up with a healthy understanding of love. I always knew and denied it numerous times, but it was more apparent than ever. Knowing this and the fact I'm facing other personal issues that I was in denial for so long about, it's peaceful for the moment before it becomes angering. You don't know what to do about it.\n\nBut you can start by not being cynical about love and not having a negative mindset/outlook on love. Recite affirmations and speak of love in a positive light rather than negatively.\n\nIf you know love, you'll find this book as a reminder and quotes here worth using. Perhaps even a new perspective.\n\nIf you don't know love, I urge you to read this book. It won't disappoint.",

        "comment": "There aren't many public discussions of love in America outside of popular culture -- movies, music, books, magazines -- but there should be, because lack of an expansive understanding of and capacity for love is behind much that is wrong in our society. When bell hooks noticed that the world she was living in \"was no longer open to love\" and that \"lovelessness had become the order of the day,\" she decided to write about it. \"I began thinking and writing about love when I heard cynicism instead of hope in the voices of young and old,\" she says.\nThe result is a book that's a refreshing change from relationship advice books that completely overlook the cultural context of love -- the ways in which love is difficult for both men and women, but especially for women, in a patriarchal culture; the ways in which a more expansive understanding of love is sorely needed to set things right in a country run by fear. hooks begins by addressing the pervasive confusion about what love is, defining it as M. Scott Peck does: \"The will to extend oneself for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.\"\nThe chapters in which hooks names \"the ways we are seduced away from love\" read as a litany of soul-corroding cultural norms. There is, most fundamentally, injustice to children in dysfunctional families in a culture where family dysfunction is normalized. Then there's the increasing prevalence of lying in public and private transactions alike, most recently exemplified in the Enron scandal and the priest-pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church. There's the cultural obsession with power and domination instead of a love ethic. (hooks pulls no punches when she states: \"An overall cultural embrace of a love ethic would mean that we would all oppose much of the public policy conservatives condone and support.\") There's also the vast and unending greed encouraged by a consumerist society. And last but not least, there's our collective fear of and at the same time worship of death. (What else could explain the great popularity of movies saturated with violence, such as \"Lord of the Rings\"?)\nThen there are the chapters where hooks explores the importance of self-love, the reality of divine love, the crucial role played by friendships and communities, the role of romantic love in helping us resolve and transform family-of-origin wounds if approached consciously, the real healing power of true love, and the yearning for love that lies behind the popular fascination with angels. The only topic I found missing from her comprehensive look at love is biophilia, that love of nature named by Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson. I'm coming to realize that any concept of intimacy with our particular place on earth is sorely absent from most American lives, imperiling our planet's health as well as our own.\nThroughout the book, it's hooks's personal revelations that make what she says credible and that especially strike a chord in me. I found in her a sister spirit. Just my age, she could be describing my relationship history when she describes her own. And herein lies my biggest quibble with the book: wishing to avoid the kind of disappointments in relationships with men I've had in the past, I want to believe that I can find satisfying love with a male, but the many generalizations hooks makes about men in our culture make me wonder. I fear she may be right when she says that \"most men feel that they receive love and therefore know what it feels like to be loved; women often feel we are in a constant state of yearning, wanting love but not receiving it\" (p. xx).\nAccording to hooks, many, if not most, men under patriarchy tell lies \"to avoid confrontation or taking responsibility for inappropriate behavior\" (p. 36), \"use psychological terrorism as a way to subordinate women\" (p. 41), \"are especially inclined to see love as something they should receive without expending effort . . . . [and] do not want to do the work that love demands\" (p. 114), are usually prevented by sexist thinking from \"acknowledging their longing for love or their acceptance of a female as their guide on love's path\" (p. 156), \"are convinced that their erotic longing indicates who they should, and can, love . . . . [and] tend to be more concerned about sexual performance and sexual satisfaction than whether they are capable of giving and receiving love\" (pp. 174, 176), and \"choose relationships in which they can be emotionally withholding when they feel like it but still receive love from someone else. . . . [and ultimately] choose power over love\" (p. 187). Hmmm. Men, what do you say to this? Can you deny it?\n\"Profound changes in the way we think and act must take place if we are to create a loving culture,\" writes hooks. I, for one, would welcome those changes and am working on making them in myself. Despite being marred by unfortunate typos (\"Living by a Love Ethnic\" [viii], \"perfect love casts our fear\" [220]), this is a courageous and important book that should be read widely and taken to heart.",

        "comment": "I'm glad I finally read this book. Strangely, I first heard reference to it in a song and years later saw a recommendation for the book online. I decided to borrow the book from the library. About two chapters in I knew I needed to buy this book! I liked it so much, I recommended it to a friend and keep it out on display in my living room. I gave the book 4 out of 5 stars because I felt some parts in the middle were repetitive, but overall this is a fantastic book. There were things I already knew or had thought about, but reading through Bell Hook's thoughts on the matter helped me put things into perspective. What really helped this book resonate with me is that I took my time reading over the course of several weeks. I'd read a chapter and then do a self deep dive over what I read and what it all meant. This is a pretty easy read and I felt if I read it all in one or two sittings I would miss alot of the points she was trying to get across. Though this book is mostly told from the female perspective, I recommend this book to anyone both male and female at any stage in your love life. There are some good chapters that dive a bit into the male mind, so I believe the guys will gain some insight into what love means for them. However, if I'm not mistaken, I believe Hooks has written another book that caters more toward men on this subject.",

    "synopsis": "A revised and updated edition of Emily Nagoski’s game-changing New York Times bestseller Come As You Are, featuring new information and research on mindfulness, desire, and pleasure that will radically transform your sex life.\n\nFor much of the 20th and 21st centuries, women’s sexuality was an uncharted territory in science, studied far less frequently—and far less seriously—than its male counterpart.\n\nThat is, until Emily Nagoski’s Come As You Are, which used groundbreaking science and research to prove that the most important factor in creating and sustaining a sex life filled with confidence and joy is not what the parts are or how they’re organized but how you feel about them. In the years since the book’s initial publication, countless women have learned through Nagoski’s accessible and informative guide that things like stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman’s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it—and that even if you don’t always feel like it, you are already sexually whole by just being yourself. This revised and updated edition continues that mission with new information and advanced research, demystifying and decoding the science of sex so that everyone can create a better sex life and discover more pleasure than you ever thought possible.",

In particular, learning about nonconcordance and the dual control system gave me a much greater understanding of myself.\n\nVery minor nitpicks: the author's insistence that \"everyone is normal\" kind of goes against the definition of the word (as in common, typical, expected). Why does everyone have to be? It's okay to be an outlier - normalcy doesn't have any morality associated with it. Neither does abnormality.\n\nThe author also insists that \"everyone is beautiful\" - which somewhat misses the point that body positivity feels unrealistic or unattainable to many people. If this is the case for you, I'd recommend checking out other books about \"body neutrality\" - I recommend the one by Eleanor Clark.",

    "ratingStarts": "4.5 out of 5 stars",
    "synopsis": "One of the darkest days in American history became an extraordinary story of courage under fire.\n\nCourage under Fire is United States Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund’s gripping personal account that takes readers inside the events leading up to January 6, and provides a detailed and harrowing minute-by-minute account of the attack on the US Capitol, which was valiantly defended in hand-to-hand combat by the US Capitol Police officers who found themselves outnumbered fifty-eight to one.\n\nCourage under Fire draws upon audio recordings, key documents, and government records as it traces Sund’s extraordinary journey from his command post on January 6 to his explosive behind-closed-doors testimony before the January 6 committee.\n\nSteven A. Sund, one of only ten men in history to hold the title of Chief of the US Capitol Police, has coordinated dozens of National Special Security Events, responded to numerous critical incidents and active shooter events, and has protected every living US president. But nothing could have prepared him for the violent attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThree days before the attack, Chief Sund requested the assistance of the National Guard. This request was denied. In preparation for the Joint Session of Congress, Chief Sund directed every available sworn officer to be on duty to protect the Capitol and all of its members and staff.\n\nBut it wasn’t enough.\n\nThe savage attack that followed was a well-planned and carefully coordinated armed assault on the United States Capitol, involving thousands. The shock and horror of this attack exploded on TV screens worldwide as US Capitol Police officers under Chief Sund’s command found themselves facing a violent siege, hit with pipes, fire extinguishers, boards, and flag poles. Dedicated men and women were knocked unconscious and sprayed with mace and bear spray as live pipe bombs were discovered at the national headquarters of both major political parties.\n\nFinally, multiple police lines were breached. Then the building was breached. The National Guard didn’t arrive until it was much too late. In the end, 150 officers were seriously injured, and nine Americans were dead.\n\nNow, for the first time, Chief Steven Sund has written the definitive inside story of the perfect storm of events that led up to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, a day that rocked the nation and threatened our democracy. As the Capitol descended into chaos, insurrectionists infiltrated and stormed its hallowed halls and democracy was pushed to the brink. Few people realize just how close we came to seeing the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and countless members of Congress beaten, maimed, or killed.\n\nThere have been many false reports and outright lies concerning the conduct of the US Capitol Police on January 6, and there has been no accountability for the individuals who bear most of the responsibility for the failures that left the USCP unprepared that day—from the shocking failures in intelligence to the outright stonewalling Chief Sund received from the Pentagon when he repeatedly called for the National Guard’s help, even as the attack on the Capitol was raging.\n\nTwo years later, so many questions still remain unanswered: What did the intelligence community know about the plans of the insurrectionists before the attack? Why was the request for the National Guard continually denied and delayed? Why was the nation’s capital so vulnerable?\n\nForced to take the fall and resign, this is Chief Sund’s chance to answer those questions and to tell the full truth about what really happened on January 6.",

        "comment": "This is the statement I hear from politicians who supported trump's lies about losing the election. Remember when they stood shoulder to shoulder on the capitol steps denying the election results? All because trump told them to do so?\n\nChief Steven Sund has firsthand information detailed quite thorough in his book. He calls out Speaker Pelosi who denied his request for the National Guard to be present 3 days before the 6th. Her reason: she didn't like the idea of soldiers present during the election certification. He calls out President Biden for what the author claims to be inappropriate. He calls out others who shirked responsibility. However, I didn't find any pages where he called out Donald Trump. If I missed those pages, then I offer my apology. I don't believe any of us can be 'apolitical.' I'm a veteran and know I wasn't. I know who is responsible for what happened that day, including all of those supporting his lies from the start. They share responsibility in the insurrection. I'm just surprised the author didn't call them out for it. After all, they did what we saw on live TV and a person like Sund would make an impact if he did make such a statement. Sort of like General Matthis calling trump 'immature, unprofessional, and a threat to national security.' Mattis wasn't the media, nor the opposition. He was a member of trump's staff. His words matter, same as Sunds'.\n\nI don't believe Sund failed in his job and was definitely a scapegoat. After all, not a single member of congress was harmed. Can't say the same for the officers defending them. God bless them. In any case, if you are looking for firsthand information as to what happened, Sund's book offers it. We still have many questions left unanswered. Such as why are Pelosi and Shumer's texts kept sealed from investigation? Why did the Secret Service delete texts? At times the author sounded like he spent his career in a bubble. Stating how police do not infringe on civilians' rights and that the media and public are against all the police. We support the police, but not the officers who infringed on George Floyd and Brionna Taylors' rights. I'd say those occurrences are enough to incite a reason to protest. Not violently, but certainly to protest. In any case, this is a good book, not necessarily a must-read, but if you want detailed information from a firsthand account, then I highly recommend Sund's book.",

        "comment": "The January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol will occupy a place in this nation’s history. Courage Under Fire provides an essential record of events before, during and immediately after the attack. The book is authored by the former Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund, who was at the center of the crises on that day.\n\nChief Sund is a career law enforcement officer with impeccable qualifications for the position of chief of the Capitol Police. He served a distinguished 25 year career with the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, and three years with the Capitol Police where he was leading the department forward. He also earned two masters degrees, from Johns Hopkins University and from the Naval Postgraduate school. Not only was Chief Sund incredibly well qualified to lead the Capitol Police, he was also proved masterful in describing the events of January 6, through his own uniquely personal experience.\n\nOur nation’s leaders, both in the executive and legislative branch, should read this book. It is clear that the extreme violence and breach of the capitol could have been prevented on that terrible day. The lessons learned here, if heeded, can prevent this tragedy from happening again. Law enforcement executives need to be reminded that the pure collection of intelligence is futile if it isn’t appropriately shared with law enforcement partners at the correct levels within those agencies; and, preparations are not made to prevent and respond to the worst case scenarios. Credit to Chief Sund for making this abundantly clear.\n\nThankfully, for the reader, the author provided an appendix of “initialisms” - acronyms used throughout the text, mostly describing the various units within the Capitol Police structure. Beyond that, the book is interesting, fast moving and shocking to say the least. Understandably, Chief Sund alone can never explain all that demands explanation from this national tragedy. Courage Under Fire is exceptionally informative and a most worthwhile read.",

Chief Sund’s balanced and apolitical set of pragmatic prescriptions for improvement stand on firm ground, and history should reflect that. Thankfully, his scholarship has enabled him to memorialize such a uniquely positioned lens for all to read with the brightest transparency.\n\nMy heart breaks all the way to the final page.

In doing so, he exposed the institutions, scholars, and activists leading the revolution. Now, he picks up where he left off: to hold responsible the true malefactors steering our country down the wrong path.\n\nInsightful and hard-hitting as ever, Levin proves that since its establishment, the Democrat Party has set out to rewrite history and destroy the foundation of freedom in America. More than a political party, it is the entity through which Marxism has installed its philosophy and its new revolution.\n\nAs in a Thomas Paine pamphlet or a clarion call from Paul Revere, Levin alerts his fellow Americans to the destruction this country is facing, and rallies them to defeat the threat in front of us—more looming than ever. He writes, “Every legal, legitimate, and appropriate tool and method must be employed in the short- and long- run to defeat the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party must be resoundingly conquered in the next election and several elections thereafter, or it will become extremely difficult to undo the damage it is unleashing at breakneck pace.”",

    "synopsis": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nA dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.\n\nFor generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.\n\nDrawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.\n\nThe Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.\n\nIncludes Black-and-White Illustrations",

        "comment": "Reading The Dawn of Everything is an ambitious undertaking, especially for those of us who are not scholars of ancient civilizations. The writing itself is often academic, with scholarly cliches and insider quips. But stick with it!! The overall quality of the work will transform the way you think about history. Instead of reading entire chapters in a single sitting, try tackling small sections within each chapter that are clearly marked by large sub-headers. Often the sub-headers pose questions and are a clever way of prompting the book’s readers to re-imagine human history. Is the narrative that we have been led to believe about human history true or accurate? Yes and No.\n\nWhat we have been taught about history according to the conventional line of thinking contains false narrative. Plenty of credence has been given to the transformation humanity made when it transitioned from being a hunter-gatherer society to becoming an agricultural, food-producing society. This assumption is both right and wrong. In many instances, there is no clear demarcation as to when this transformation took place. Furthermore, there were many ancient societies who adopted agriculture as a fledgling practice, only to later reject it and revert back to the immediacy and efficiency of a hunter-gatherer way of life.\n\nConsider the following: Whole parts or entire centuries of human history have never been recorded. And when human history has been recorded, the task was often done by the victors of war, not the vanquished. Winners and losers notwithstanding, it is time for us to find out what is true and what is not. Here is one bonafide truism: from the beginning of human history, there has always been an ongoing tension between communities who wanted to be self-governing (egalitarian) and those who wanted to rule top-down (authoritarian) by exerting their control over communities in order to amass power, wealth, or perhaps even to court the favors of the gods. Interestingly, these two divergent forms of cultures coexisted concurrently during the same period in time, and in some cases lived not far apart geographically.\n\nFor example, the indigenous people of California had markedly different values than the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest. The California indigenous people—Yurok—had values similar to the early Puritans with a cultural emphasis on stoicism and simplicity, decrying wastefulness or excess. The Northwest indigenous peoples enjoyed loud, large-scale grand celebrations, replete with gluttonous feasting and messianic dancing that went on for days, and were fond of acquiring slaves, a practice that was an anathema to the Yurok. The two societies, who were in contact with one another, defined themselves by their differences in the same way the Greek societies of Athens and Sparta defined their identities by one being the polar opposite of the other.\n\nSchismogenesis is the term coined by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson to define how two very different cultures are able to form a solid identity because of the existence of the other. Think of how the alt-right and GOP define their beliefs that are precisely so unlike what liberals and progressives believe. Consider how the authoritarian state of Russia is driven to conquer and subsume the democratic nation of Ukraine. Here is another bonafide truism: from the beginning of history, the self-governing (egalitarian) and top-down rulers (authoritarian) have been able to successfully manage the dynamic tension between them to live in a guarded but peaceful coexistence. On the other hand, the two cultures have erupted into warfare, destruction, and the immolation of one culture at the expense of another. Aside from having better weapons or more advanced technology, the chief factor in predicting which type of community ultimately flourished—either the self-governing or the top-down—is by examining who left behind the better narrative. Who recorded history? The victors or the vanquished?\n\nThere has always been a commonly held belief among historians and teachers of history that the origins of self-governing societies came about due to the influence of men like Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacque Rousseau, John Locke, (Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l'Aulne conspicuously known as Turgot), Charles Montesquieu, and half a dozen other political philosophers whose brilliant thinking shaped the democracy that we know and enjoy today. Conventional notions about the history of humanity have been derived from western thinkers and are the backbone, or backstory, of what we learn in school; it’s what our high school history teachers taught us to believe.\n\nSo, it might come to a surprise to those of us who were taught by staid history teachers to learn that many indigenous cultures were indeed the first egalitarian cultures who supported individual freedom. It might come as a further surprise to learn that some of the fundamental tenets of our American democracy originated with indigenous peoples and not with the litany of great western thinkers. The western thinkers who wrote a trove of essays and treatises about democracy did not give credit where credit was due—to indigenous peoples, but they did indeed leave behind the better narrative.\n\nTake Charles Montesquieu; there is no question that Montesquieu had a profound influence on the formation of democracy. Montesquieu’s theories were put into practice by founding fathers of the United States when they framed the U.S. Constitution. His theory of creating a system of checks and balances, and the separation of powers among the executive, judicial and legislature branches of government, was intended to ensure a balance of power that would preserve the spirit of individual liberty. What is not commonly known is that Montesquieu’s thinking was profoundly influenced by the Osage, a Native American tribe of the Great Plains. Montesquieu’s learning derived from the Osage gave him the impetus to build an explicit theory of institutional reform in his book “The Spirit of the Laws,” which is widely hailed as a blueprint to create a government that is based on laws, not men—and that is precisely what the early framers of the U.S Constitution created.\n\nIt has been further proposed that Haudenosaunee federal structures (the six nations of the Iroquois) might have also served as a model for the U.S. Constitution. According to the book’s authors, it is interesting that “any suggestion that European thinkers learned anything of moral or social value from indigenous people is met with derision to condemnation.” The Jesuits, who have traditionally been deemed as the arbiters of cogent thinking about democracy, proclaimed the abhorrence of freedom that they witnessed among indigenous peoples, calling it the “wicked liberty of the savages.” In their observation of the Wendat they fail to see how their freedom had anything to do with the Eurasian notion of “equality before the law.”\n\nAlong comes Wendat philosopher statesman Kandiaronk, an elegant, erudite thinker who is as comfortable among his own indigenous people as he is interacting with the European newcomers who have made their way to North America. The Wendat and other indigenous people are astonished in their observation of the earliest European missionaries for their squabbling and backbiting over their possessions and property. These newcomers fail to offer support to one another and their submission to authority amounts to little more than blind obedience. Worse of all, the new settlers used their power over possessions and property as a way to exert control and power over other human beings. It was only a matter of time when Kandiaronk, who is cast with the slur “noble savage,” is eventually heralded by European thinkers as one of the by the great thinkers of the day. In Jean-Jacque Rousseau’s essay “The discourse on the origins of social inequality,” he asks, “How is it that Europeans are able to turn a mere unequal distribution of material goods into the ability to tell others what to do, to employ them as servants…or to feel that it was no concern of theirs if they were left dying in a feverish bundle on the street?”\n\nThe actualization of the self-governing (egalitarian) versus top-down rulers (authoritarian) becomes more than a dynamic tension between two different types of cultures, but it is at the very crux of how power and wealth came to shape the world we live in today. A very small percentage of the world’s population do control the fates of everyone else and are doing so in an increasingly disastrous fashion. A quick recap of some of the most pressing problems in the 21st Century, ranging from climate change, and grossly unfair economic practices governing energy and food production to nuclear proliferation and imperialist acts of aggression that cause great human harm and suffering, all of these issues and more provide a clear bellwether of the predicament that we find ourselves in.\n\nHow did we get here? This is the proposition often asserted by authors David Graeber and David Wengrow. The answer is more complex than viewing humans as either innately self-governing (egalitarian) or innately top-down (authoritarian). The authors address seasonality among ancient communities, that is when the same society alternated, switching back and forth, between self-governing and top-down modalities depending on the time of year—harvest required a stricter division of labor, but the summer might bring about days of creative play. “If human beings, through most of our history, have moved back and forth fluidly between different social arrangements, assembling and dismantling hierarchies on a regular basis, then maybe the real question should be ‘how did we get stuck?’”\n\nMaybe a more precise question arises: Why can’t we move back and forth between self-governing (egalitarian) or innately top-down (authoritarian) based on what our society needs at a given moment? On the other hand, isn’t that what we do in post-modern democracy when we vote for new leadership during an election? The Dawn of Everything inevitably inspires readers to ask these questions. Despite the regularity of modern-day elections and the continuing dynamic tension between self-governing (egalitarian) or top-down (authoritarian) modalities, the pendulum never swings too far toward freedom. Humans have lost the flexibility and freedom to manage their own lives and are stuck being subordinate to the overwhelming domination of possessions and property, where money rules and where money makes the laws and the moral code we are required to abide by.\n\nTo examine why humans get stuck, we take a journey through numerous archeological sites, many of them obscure to those of us who are not scholars of ancient civilizations: Gobekli Tepe (southeastern Turkey), Poverty Point (northeastern Louisiana), Sannai Maruyama (northern Japan), Stonehenge (southern England).We learn it is impossible to know what forms of property or ownership existed. If private property has an origin, a pattern of belief and practice as old as the idea of the sacred or divine, the question remains: how did incessant squabbling and backbiting over possessions and property take hold in so many aspects of human affairs?\n\nGoing back to the dawn of everything takes us to Catalhoyuk, an ancient city in Turkey circa 7400 BC where evidence of successful Matriarchate or mother rule is deemed to be more than a way to run a society but is the foundation for the collective unconscious. Minangkabau, a Muslim people of Sumatra, also describe themselves as matriarchal. Other indigenous peoples, the Wendat, Hopi and Zuni, also qualify as matriarchies. It is no wonder that Kandiaronk, the great democratic thinker, lived among the Wendat. Matriarchal cultures are self-governing (egalitarian), and emphasize social cooperation, civic activism, hospitality and simply caring for others.\n\nArcheologist Marija Gimbutas preferred to define these societies as matric instead of as matriarchy, citing the latter as a mirror image of patriarchy. The political rule of women is further defined as Gynarchy or Gynaecocracy. For example, Minoan Crete, from 1,700 to 1450 BC offers no clear archeological evidence of a monarchy. In its art, artifacts and bones, women are found to weigh in on a larger scale than are men. Most of the available evidence from Minoan Crete suggests it was self-governing (egalitarian), a theocracy governed by a college of priestesses. After exhaustive research of the matric societies in ancient history, archeologist Marija Gimbutas revealed her findings. She was shunned and dismissed by her colleagues—the male academic and scientific community.\n\nHistorically, (the history we learn in school), greater emphasis is placed on Pharaonic Egypt, Han China, Inca Peru, Aztec Mexico, Imperial Rome and Ancient Greece, all rigid rank and file societies held together by top-down (authoritarian) government, where violence was rampant, and the radical subordination of women was the norm. Why top-down authoritarian governments dominate the narrative as being the official rendering of history is, in and of itself, a topic worthy of exploration. Now here is the good news: eventually human history does tell its own story, one that is greater than the narrative spouted by the victors. The real story of human history is told through its art, artifacts and the bones it has left behind.\n\nConventional patriarchal thinking about the dominance of a winner take all, top-down (authoritarian) modality points to our fall from the garden of Eden—the Faustian pact humans made with wheat, the domestication of large seeded grasses, marking the transition from the hunter-gather society to becoming an agricultural food-producing society. This assumption is dim and narrow, especially when there are so many other factors to consider, weighing in on everything from the personalities of would-be kings to understanding how Mesopotamian urbanites were organized into autonomous self-governing units. The story of Gilgamesh and Agga, about the war between Uruk and Kish, describing a city council divided into two chambers, will keep you up at night because it is too reminiscent of the schisms between the right and the left in the U.S. Congress in our post-modern world.\n\nThe Dawn of Everything was never intended to be a good read in the same vein as a pop-nonfiction page-turner. The many ancient civilizations that are explored will force you to read and reread passages to commit names, dates and circumstances to memory, and there are more footnotes than a non-academic can bear! If it’s hard to read, then why bother? The Dawn of Everything is complex and brilliant as much as it is simple and brilliant, and that puts human history into perspective. For example, the invention of the light bulb had huge ramifications for the modern world. Yet many Neolithic discoveries had the cumulative effect of shaping everyday life as profoundly as the lightbulb: bread rising, cultivation of crops and growth cycles, ceramics, mining, all of which are still with us today.\n\nIn the parade of ancient communities that are explored in The Dawn of Everything, we are able to consider the epoch transitions in history: Agriculture, Industrialization, Transportation, Energy, Technology, and how each transition impacted the ongoing dynamic tension between the self-governing (egalitarian) and top-down (authoritarian) modalities. We might find that there are no sure answers, but we can embrace the following truth: Freedom is a constant struggle. We are also left with the burning desire to ask the right question: How did our post-modern world arrive at this point and place time? This is especially important to ask in our current age, which is steeped in Kairos—an opportune moment in history, when real change is not only possible but inevitable. You can’t come to a fork in the road to make a decision, unless you have taken the journey to get there, and reading the Dawn of Everything is that journey.\n\nWe are hereinafter called to ask the right questions about the true origins of history and to use our imagination instead of accepting false narrative by glossing over the parts of human history that were never recorded or intentionally omitted. There is much still to be learned and we don’t know all of the answers. The version of history that is accepted by the governing few can dictate how historians and teachers of history decide what is true. However, at the end of the day, mass graves and archeological sites do distinguish self-governing (egalitarian) societies from those that were top-down (authoritarian). One final truism: If we know where the art, the artifacts and the bodies are buried, the bones do not lie.\n\n#\nNote: I wrote this book review to pay tribute to David Graeber who died to due to Covid-related complications in 2020, before he could see the publication of The Dawn of Everything. What a powerful legacy! I want to extend a sincere thanks to both authors David Graeber and David Wengrow for undertaking this project. I learned to think about history in way that re-imagines the possibilities for all of us and for that I am grateful.",

        "comment": "What readers find in The Dawn Of Everything will depend on what they bring to the book. Readers who found merit in 1619 will find the material surprising, but comfortable. Those who believe The 1776 Report will be challenged.\n\nIn broad strokes what have Graeber and Wengrow offered? Western society shares an ethos that grew out of the struggle during the Age of Enlightenment to replace the Divine Right of Kings with personal sovereignty: individual freedom. Locke and Rousseau are central figures in this movement, and both drew on Iroquoian speaking Wendat and Haudenosaunee nations to create rhetorical examples of freedom. As Graeber and Wengrow explain in detail, that American freedom had been unimaginable in English thought.\n\n• Women’s freedom before marriage, their right to divorce, gamble, their authority to control land through complex laws and declare war.\n• Society without money\n• The inability to use wealth to force compliance from others\n• The absence of laws\n• The equality of all people including council leaders\n• Their ability to discuss issues of government and politics better that the European politicians and priests.\n\nThe limitation Enlightenment thinkers struggled with was their certainty the England had evolved to the highest possible state, justifying that in part with A. R. J. Turgot’s theory of societal evolution. That evolution model explained the necessary and inescapable transition from the rhetorical ideal of free savages to the inequality in England at the start of industrialization. James Scott recently made the same argument blaming the sedentary life associated with dependence on grain. Graeber and Wengrow point out that despite important and well know exceptions to the evolutionary model, anthropologists simply added new sub-categories into the 70s rather than challenge the model.\n\nBeginning with a simple observation the authors reject the social evolution model, and with it challenge the assumption that large or complex societies must always by coercive and structured by inequality. Their observation: why, with diverse populations in diverse setting over a 40,000 or 120,000 year span, do we assume the people tried a single evolutionary model of society? The answer from both archaeology and paleontology is that people tried many arrangements. Some cultures adopted agriculture only to reject it. The development of cities was not always a response to war. From the knowledge we managed to save and the complexity of the monuments constructed going back to Göbekli Tepe (9,000 BCE) large groups of people were able to organize, plan, and create large projects that upend the popular assumption that “savages,” or “primitives” were apelike in the behavior and reasoning.\n\nThe writing is easy to read, the points easy to follow. What some people will find troubling is discovering the implications of their writing. Most of us take for granted that our politics, inequality, and racism are somehow justified by the laws of economics or societal evolution. At least when paired with information about the Age of Enlightenment and the failure to fully implement those ideals in the Constitution, Dawn Of Everything becomes a work subversive to American complacency.\n\nBecause Locke’s several appearances in the book are important, I’ll present one example using him. In The Two Treaties of Government, Locke argues that God gave the Earth’s bounty to all people: all races, all genders, all ages. Every person had exactly the same rights to the Earth’s bounty. As each person hunted and gathered they were entitled to take what they needed within limits. No person could take more than he or she could use. That created waste and raised the problem of surplus. Further, no person could take or control so much of a thing or area that the lack of it harmed another.\n\nThat idyllic setting is the context for understanding how images of freedom inspired Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers,\n\n\"To Americans like Kandiaronk, there was no contradiction between individual liberty and communism...in the sense we’ve been using it here, as a certain presumption of sharing, that people who aren’t actual enemies can be expected to respond to one another’s needs. In the American view, the freedom of the individual was assumed to be premised on a certain level of ‘base-line communism,’ since, after all, people who are starving or lack adequate clothes or shelter in a snowstorm are not really free to do much of anything other than whatever it takes to stay alive.\" (page 66)\n\nDeeply committed to private property, Locke and the others were unwilling to identify and implement the changes necessary to achieve freedom Locke's four \"natural rights.\" Instead, Enlightenment thinkers created individual freedom based on a right to coerce behavior through their control of property, resources, or people.\n\n\"The European conception of individual freedom was, by contrast, tied ineluctably to notions of private property. Legally, this association traces back above all to the power of the male household head in ancient Rome, who could do whatever he liked with his chattels and possessions, including his [wife,] children and slaves. In this view, freedom was always defined – at least potentially – as something exercised to the cost of others. What’s more, there was a strong emphasis in ancient Roman (and modern European) law on the self-sufficiency of households; hence, true freedom meant autonomy in the radical sense, not just autonomy of the will, but being in no way dependent on other human beings (except those under one’s direct control).\" (page 66-57)\n[Insert added]\n\nThe Dawn Of Everything is an invitation to look at the amazing diversity of answers to how people can organize their governments and economics. The authors leave to their readers to argue which might be better. They create an awareness that choice is possible and that the government and economy we have are some combination of stumbling blindly, happenstance, and greed.",

        "comment": "As a survivor myself, I found she said things that were seriously identical to how I felt. Literally had exact same thoughts or feelings that I had and it felt surreal to me. A very strong feeling of “Wow! It wasn’t just me” type thing.\nI do believe she went through a horrific childhood and had genuine struggles and experiences, but I really wish the book would have been strictly factual. While embellishing does make it interesting, it IS harder to feel a true connection when you are unsure what is a lie or what is truth. Also, sometimes it was downright confusing or puzzling. There were several times she would just randomly say something happened long after the fact or simply hint at it happening, but it was nowhere in the book. Like saying people kept coming up to her at school to share their stories. Or the ones making rude comments. Or the fact that she wrote in journals growing up, but nowhere in the story does it say she was publishing things as a child.\n\nAnd I do agree with other reviewers a little. The author claims to have gone through ALL of that abuse to save her siblings, but really she saved no one at all. She still allowed them to be severely beaten and starved in front of her? So how was she saving them? It wasn’t her “job” to do any saving or anything, but it’s the repeated claim that she did that is throwing people off.\nI wish the book also had more information on the siblings and how they coped. And I wanted to know more about her parents. Why does she not have any anger for her mother? Her mother was also a monster so why is it directed to only 1 parent? And why does the mother have zero consequences? How much was true about Paul? Did she really attach herself so strongly to him that she was willing to try cheating on her loving and loyal man just because he messaged her? Paul, in the book, was a total tool. Why was she glued to the kid who literally avoided her and treated her like trash when she had someone else there for her who loved her? I really wish we knew the truths from the lies 🤷🏻‍♀️.\n\nPs. After I read the book I looked her up online. No matter how much is embellished in the story, she still had a horrible experience that none of us should ever go through. And she is literally fighting for her life today. Life is just not fair. I am glad I bought and read this book, if only to help ease her families struggles in a monetary way. I wish her the best in healing",

    "synopsis": "The visionary behind the bestselling phenomenon The Fourth Turning looks once again to America’s past to predict our future in this startling and hopeful prophecy for how our present era of civil unrest will resolve over the next ten years—and what our lives will look like once it has.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Neil Howe and the late William Strauss dazzled the world with a provocative new theory of American history. Looking back at the last 500 years, they’d uncovered a distinct pattern: modern history moves in cycles, each one lasting roughly eighty to one hundred years, the length of a long human life, with each cycle composed of four eras—or “turnings”—that always arrive in the same order and each last about twenty years. The last of these eras—the fourth turning—was always the most perilous, a period of civic upheaval and national mobilization as traumatic and transformative as the New Deal and World War II, the Civil War, or the American Revolution.\n\nNow, right on schedule, our own fourth turning has arrived. And so Neil Howe has returned with an extraordinary new prediction. What we see all around us—the polarization, the growing threat of civil conflict and global war—will culminate by the early 2030s in a climax that poses great danger and yet also holds great promise, perhaps even bringing on America’s next golden age. Every generation alive today will play a vital role in determining how this crisis is resolved, for good or ill.\n\nIlluminating, sobering, yet ultimately empowering, The Fourth Turning Is Here takes you back into history and deep into the collective personality of each living generation to make sense of our current crisis, explore how all of us will be differently affected by the political, social, and economic challenges we’ll face in the decade to come, and reveal how our country, our communities, and our families can best prepare to meet these challenges head-on.",

You could save a lot of time by skipping over everything until then. I did appreciate that Howe seemed to try to stay politically neutral, however I also felt that in doing so, the result was the \"bothsidesing\" of incipient fascism.\nOverall, a good read.",

But as Fukuyama criticized in the NYT, Howe is tying this up a little too neat. If nothing else, and ironically, Howe is writes about the Crisis as an era of fear mongers while he stokes (and prolongs as he deems necessary to sell books?) the idea that there is more - a decade more - of fear and dismay for us to endure.\n\nThis moving of goal posts aside, my biggest beef isn’t when the crisis will end but how Howe didn’t acknowledge that today’s older generations are perhaps hip to the cycle. We’ve never had people both alive and governing into their 80s. They may prove their worth yet by understanding that we (a) need out of this crisis, (b) need a new civic order, and (c) don’t need a war to get there. That may be the biggest blessing that prolonged life has for the trajectory of humanity.",

        "comment": "The United States in 2023 is an uneasy place, rife with dissension and uncertain of its future. It's been that way for quite awhile, it seems, perhaps all the way back to 9/11, and certainly since the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. In The Fourth Turning Is Here Neil Howe assures us that our lack of ease is based on something far more than just the ups and downs of economics, politics, and foreign policy. Continuing the work he began with the late William Strauss in Generations and The Fourth Turning in the 1990s, Howe explains that Anglo-American history has been rotating through a series of cycles or turnings ever since the late Middle Ages. At present we are in a Crisis period which Howe projects will come to an end sometime around 2033. After that we will begin a new saeculum, or cycle, with a First Turning of recovery and growing prosperity.\n\nIf you've read Strauss and Howe's earlier works you'll find much that is familiar or even repeated in the first sections of The Fourth Turning Is Here, but with Howe's new perspectives after twenty years of observation the older material gains fresh focus and interest. The most intriguing parts of the book deal with Howe's projections of what is to come in the next few decades. I'm a Boomer in my 60s who, as a retired teacher, taught many GenX and Millennial students in my day, so it's interesting, albeit forboding at times, to read Howe's speculations.\n\nThe book is well written and always fascinating. It is meticulously footnoted (you should not overlook the Notes that accompany the footnotes) and the historical speculations are plausible. The next few decades will be momentous, as decades always are, and it's good to have a well thought out guide to what it all possibly means like The Fourth Turning Is Here.",

The book will give you a perspective on our current climate that is beyond any personal world view bias. And it will explained why you have that bias.\n\nMore importantly it will paint a vivid picture of the next few decades. The smart reader will appreciate the historical trends and incorporate it into their future plans and strategy. It is worth more than its weight in gold with a roadmap for a future that we may not like, but can plan for and thrive within.\n\nIt is a must read and has become one of the top 5 books I have ever read.",

    "synopsis": "A New Yorker Best Book of the Year\n\nWhat happened to Rudy Giuliani?\n\nAndrew Kirtzman, who has been following Giuliani since the 1990s, answers that question in this “masterful and engrossing” (The Guardian) biography that “cuts through the myth and caricature that has too often defined Giuliani” (Los Angeles Times).\n\nRudy Giuliani was hailed after 9/11 as “America’s Mayor,” a national hero who, at the time, was more widely admired than the pope. He was brilliant, accomplished—and complicated. He conflated politics with morality, made reckless personal choices, and engaged in self-destructive behavior. A series of disastrous decisions and cynical compromises, coupled with his need for power, money, and attention gradually ruined his reputation, cost him political support, and ultimately damaged the country.\n\nKirtzman, who was with Giuliani at the World Trade Center on 9/11, conducted hundreds of interviews to give us an insightful portrait of this polarizing figure from the beginning of his rise to his high-profile role as Donald Trump’s personal lawyer. Giuliani was a celebrated prosecutor, a transformative New York City mayor, and a contender for the presidency. But by the end of the Trump presidency, he was reviled and ridiculed after a series of embarrassing errors and misjudgments. He was a significant figure in both of Trump’s impeachments and ended up widely ostracized, facing both legal jeopardy and financial ruin.\n\nThis is the “lively new biography” (The New Yorker) of how it all began and how it came crashing down.",

        "comment": "Like may people who are probably interested in reading this book, I initially thought author Andrew Kirtzman made a bit of a mistake with the subtitle of his book. I mean Rudy Giuliani has undoubtably rose and fell, but I was skeptical of the word \"tragic\" being included what-so-ever.\n\nHowever, by the time I had gotten to the end of the book, I guess I did feel a tinge of sadness for Giuliani - even though I honestly didn't want to. I don't know if it is so much the story of this fallen icon that triggered sympathy in me or if it was just the accessibility and life imbued in Kirtzman's prose. There were parts that made me think about Giuliani and Trump's curious \"dynamic\" in a new light (it's pretty interesting why those two have been stuck together like glue) and well, when you get to the parts about Rudy's outright poisonous vendetta to take down Biden, it's difficult to not to wince when witnessing a person becoming utterly consumed by their obsessive hatred. It's that last part I think anyone reading this book can relate to. We've all been mad at another person, but if you're tripping over yourself (to an embarrassing degree) to get back at them to the point that you're essentially chasing down/creating boogiemen, YOU may have a problem that's bigger than your problem with them - even if it is real and nit just perceived.\n\nBut in the end, I think John Oliver said it best on his episode that contained a piece centered on Giuliani - \"he's always been this way.\" Indeed. The only difference now there's a lack of guardrails. And if you think that a person like Giuliani would care about the legacy he will leave behind, the answer to that may surprise you.",

(Even so, we are going to need an addendum to cover Giuliani's indictments and trials, which loom in the future.) Andrew Kirtzman knows his subject better than Giuliani knows himself, and his research is thorough and broad. At several places, he gives the reader the feeling of being in the room as plans are laid and plots spun. Unlike other works from the Trump era, we have not seen anyone disputing Kirtzman's facts or sources. Beyond the research, the book reads as a compelling novel that the reader cannot put down. Kirtzman is a great storyteller, his narrative style captures the drama of these real-life moments, and he unwinds some complicated knots. For example, I finally understand what the Mueller report actually said and who did what in the Trump-Ukraine scandal.",

But by the end of this book, even I felt a little (a very little) sympathy for him.\n\nEffective when the focus is on the RG, Andrew Kirtzman veers wildly off course when he discusses the events of the Trump presidency. Kirtzman seems unaware that many of the Trump scandals he brings up were shown, too late, to be fake. Really it is enough criticism of Trump just to point out that he often trusted the wrong people - like Guiliani. As for Guiliani's comments about Biden re Hunter's laptop and Joe's senility - seems that Rudy wasn't so crazy after all.\n\nBut at least New York worked when he was mayor.",

Readers looking to separate menopausal fact from fiction should take note.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“Gunter mixes sound medical information with a bit of humor and a lot of candor…[this] frank and expert guide provides an informative and reassuring look at a long, often baffling and infuriating phase of life.” —Booklist\n\nThe only thing predictable about menopause is its unpredictability. Factor in widespread misinformation, a lack of research, and the culture of shame around women’s bodies, and it’s no wonder women are unsure what to expect during the menopause transition and beyond.\n\nMenopause is not a disease—it’s a planned change, like puberty. And just like puberty, we should be educated on what’s to come years in advance, rather than the current practice of leaving people on their own with bothersome symptoms and too much conflicting information. Knowing what is happening, why, and what to do about it is both empowering and reassuring.\n\nFrank and funny, Dr. Jen debunks misogynistic attitudes and challenges the over-mystification of menopause to reveal everything you really need to know about:\n \n*Perimenopause * Hot flashes * Sleep disruption * Sex and libido * Depression and mood changes * Skin and hair issues * Outdated therapies * Breast health * Weight and muscle mass * Health maintenance screening * And much more!\n \nFilled with practical, reassuring information, this essential guide will revolutionize how women experience menopause—including how their lives can be even better for it!\n\n“Read this book immediately.”\n—New York Times bestseller Ayelet Waldman, author of A Really Good Day and Love & Treasure\n\n“This is the new ‘it’ book for women who want to prepare for or understand what menopause is (and isn't).”\n—Dr. Jennifer Lincoln",

        "comment": "It's definitely has more information than the average book on (peri)menopause. You will learn something. It's probably much better than the information you will get from your gynecologist who may know very little about (peri)menopause. It is without the usual misogynistic take, which is refreshing. But the books with a misogynistic take are generally written by men, and they can sometimes be very negative indeed, even though they may also contain some information. It is true this book can read as a lot of facts without interpretation. And I don't know that what every (peri)menopausal women is really looking for is a lecture on heart disease, rather than just an understanding of what is going on in their body, their symptoms, and possibly what to do about them. But it seems impossible to avoid in all books on (peri)menopause ever. So the average 40 something woman with perhaps nearly 1/2 her life ahead of her, is always not only suffering their symptoms and their stigma, but bombarded about all the ways one can die, and they wonder why we get depressed in the menopause transition: PS here are all the ways you will die!!!\n\nThe reviewers that all pounced on one negative review in unison made me wonder if I would be reading a menopause book or joining some weird twitter cult. But the book is quite solid. As for the person they pounce on, well there is no single women's experience of menopause and desire anyway, any more than all women experience desire before (peri)menopause either.\n\nI don't know that I really agree with not testing hormones in perimenopause but I realize not testing hormone levels when prescribing HRT is standard medical practice. I suspect it's pretty easy in perimenopause, though not after menopause, to overdose hormones, as even the data in this book shows you may have hormones in perimenopause, just of course they are all over the place. And maybe that's why you end up with a lot of bad HRT side effects, some of which like breast tenderness increase risk of breast cancer as per at least one study out there. I've experienced the breast pain side effect of HRT, if your medicine causes pain maybe time to listen to your body, HRT in perimenopause is very tricky if anything. The author has been taking HRT since her final period but never really explains her reasoning, bad symptoms are reason enough at least for awhile, although the comparison to her mother who completed menopause before 45 don't seem that compelling, that's considered early (but not premature) menopause, it has a higher risk of osteoporosis than a more typical age of menopause of 45-55. I also wonder, given that she ended up taking hormones anyway, why she waited until 12 months past her last period rather take them during what is often the most symptomatic time leading up to menopause.",

It wasn’t until the 100th time I dropped the book in my lap to sigh in frustration that I noticed the cover is a BULLHORN with the words “own your health with facts and feminism” HAHAHAHAHA!

Every subject is painstakingly covered in detail and no questions are left unanswered.\n\nI always saw menopause as hot flashes, night sweats, and a little bit of moodiness. I had no idea the depth and scope of all the things that menopause entails and this book was extremely enlightening.\n\nI have many sections highlighted to go over again and again as needed throughout the entire menopause process, and even beyond, and I feel so much better prepared heading into menopause now that I have all of this important information at my finger tips, as we all should.",

    "synopsis": "As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on “a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise” (Elizabeth Gilbert).\n\nDrawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings—asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass—offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.",

Robin Wall Kimmerer's work celebrates the sacred relationship between humans and the natural world and invites readers on a transformative journey that leaves a lasting imprint on the soul.\n\nThe book's structure, beautifully divided into three braids - \"Tending,\" \"Native Wisdom,\" and \"Restoration,\" - invites readers to immerse themselves in a range of experiences and perspectives. Kimmerer shares her personal encounters with nature, traditional stories, and reflections on ecological restoration, all while seamlessly integrating scientific facts that deepen our understanding of the natural world.\n\nThroughout \"Braiding Sweetgrass,\" the author's profound love for the Earth shines through, igniting a fire within readers to rekindle their own connection to nature. Her writing evokes a sense of gratitude and responsibility towards the land, encouraging us to become more mindful stewards of the gifts it generously bestows.\n\nThis book is more than just a collection of essays; it is a lifeline to wisdom passed down through generations, a bridge between cultures, and a beacon of hope for a more sustainable future. \"Braiding Sweetgrass\" will awaken your senses, fill your heart with awe, and empower you to be an active participant in the world's restoration.",

        "comment": "Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer gives a wildly new perspective on plant life and their relationship to humans. Wall Kimmerer takes us through experiences and knowledge she has gained in her life through her connection to both science and Indigenous Wisdom. Wall Kimmerer discusses the near annihilation of Indigenous people’s traditions, ideas, and languages. Not to mention their removal from their lands and their cultural assimilation into the new European-American culture. This was forced upon Indigenous people and there are still lasting effects to this day that they strive to counteract. Language is only carried on through elders that wish to pass on the language and culture to the youth. Robin Wall Kimmerer is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation and had felt disconnected from her Native American roots because of the strong American identity that had been forced upon Native Americans when Europeans arrived. By dedicating much of her time to the study of plants and the connections she can find to Indigenous Wisdom she has been able to combine both perspectives as objectively as she can.\nShe stresses the importance of the relationship between humans and the natural world. She claims that Mother Earth is showing love to us with the gift of her plants and animals and that we must show our love back and treat her with respect. For example, you must ask plants permission before you utilize them, must give an offering (in many cases some tobacco sprinkled on the ground), and must show gratitude to the Earth and the plants that replenish us. On the other hand, Wall Kimmerer discusses the negative and surprisingly positive externalities that are observed due to humans and inflicted on the Earth. As you might have guessed pollution is a big negative effect along with overhunting and the disturbance of ecosystems. However, Wall Kimmerer discovers that harvesting sweetgrass in the way that she was taught through Indigenous people is actually beneficial for the sweetgrass. Without being harvested the sweetgrass starts to die because of overcrowding and other factors. However, the harvested sweetgrass plots were flourishing. This of course relates to the title of the book which draws on the idea that Sweetgrass was one of the four sacred plants to the Potawatomi people.\nWall Kimmerer does an excellent job portraying the importance of having a mutual relationship between nature and humans. Prior to reading this book I had no idea that there was this vital relationship between us. Wall Kimmerer utilizes the relationship between her and her daughters to help readers understand that Earth shows love to us just as a mother does to her children. I thought that this was a brilliant comparison between two seemingly unrelated topics. It was a great way to explain that the plants that are provided for us on Earth aid us in living our daily lives to the fullest and it seems that we ignore her gift and repay her with pollution and overusing her gifts. Just as children sometimes forget the importance of their mothers and how grateful they should be for the numerous things they do for them everyday.\nAnother concept that Wall Kimmerer presents beautifully that adds to the book as a whole is the relationship between corn, beans, and squash as described from stories she’d heard from other Native people. They were regarded as the Three Sisters. Kimmerer compares this to the structure of human families when she says “The firstborn girl knows that she is clearly in charge; tall and direct, upright and efficient, she creates the template for everyone else to follow. That’s the corn sister...This bean girl [middle sister] learns to be flexible, adaptable, to find a way around the dominant structure to get the light that she needs. The sweet baby sister is free to choose a different path, as expectations have already been fulfilled. Well grounded, she has nothing to prove and finds her own way, a way that contributes to the good of the whole” (p.132). The plants grow in the same way as the sisters progress in life. In their own ways to come together as a collective whole. This connection truly struck me because it reminded me of my own family and my two younger siblings. Surprisingly, her description matched my family pretty well. This is a terrific way to get the reader to truly humanize the plants in a sense. As a species we tend to place things that are not as advanced as us (by our own standards if I might add) in a category below us. Yet this comparison truly allows us to look at these plants as equals with social structures just as ours. They simply communicate through methods other than speech.\nOverall, this was a lovely book that picks up on the relationship between the human world and the natural world and really made me rethink a lot about picking random flowers on the street without asking them if I can first. She utilizes her life experience perfectly in order to recount her journey to a more respectful way of treating the environment around her. This book will make you rethink your actions towards the environment and get you thinking deeper about what we can do to keep plant knowledge alive.",

    "synopsis": "The unknown story of the election that set the tone for today’s fractured politics\n \n“A fresh, authoritative analysis of a pivotal election year.”—Kirkus Reviews\n \nThe 1968 presidential race was a contentious battle between vice president Hubert Humphrey, Republican Richard Nixon, and former Alabama governor George Wallace. The United States was reeling from the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy and was bitterly divided on the Vietnam War and domestic issues, including civil rights and rising crime. Drawing on previously unexamined archives and numerous interviews, Luke A. Nichter upends the conventional understanding of the campaign. \n \nNichter chronicles how the evangelist Billy Graham met with Johnson after the president’s attempt to reenter the race was stymied by his own party, and offered him a deal: Nixon, if elected, would continue Johnson’s Vietnam War policy and also not oppose his Great Society, if Johnson would soften his support for Humphrey. Johnson agreed.\n \nNichter also shows that Johnson was far more active in the campaign than has previously been described; that Humphrey’s resurgence in October had nothing to do with his changing his position on the war; that Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” has been misunderstood, since he hardly even campaigned there; and that Wallace’s appeal went far beyond the South and anticipated today’s Republican populism. This eye-opening account of the political calculations and maneuvering that decided this fiercely fought election reshapes our understanding of a key moment in twentieth-century American history.",

        "comment": "How do you take the story of a major political event that is seemingly known through and through and upend all that we thought we knew and shed new light on the story revealing far greater detail and correcting false assumptions at the same time? Research. Through diligent research, and by reaching out to new sources of information, Luke Nichter has once again shed new light on a topic of political and historical significance, correcting misconceptions, and added new details to a period of time that was not nearly as well known or understood as previously thought. This is what historical research is all about: finding new sources, and adding those new sources to the story we already know to add to the accuracy of the story.\nLuke Nichter has done this to the highest degree. Utilizing sources previously unused such as the notebooks of Billy Graham (which in part reveal the unique and complex relationship between LBJ and Nixon), the recorded phone conversations during the 1968 election (including those between LBJ, Nixon, Humphreys, and Wallace as well as those related to the alleged role of Anna Chennault in the prevention of South Vietnam agreeing to a peace arranged through LBJ) and the numerous personal interviews conducted over the years, Luke Nichter has been able to paint the picture of the complex 1968 election with more detail and more depth than previously thought possible.\nThe inclusion of the notebooks from Billy Graham are quite revealing. The degree to which Reverend Graham relayed messages between Richard Nixon and LBJ was quite interesting and revealing. Through the notebooks of Billy Graham we are able to see how the connection between Nixon and LBJ grew, and how that relationship would continue on beyond 1968. It also shows Graham as a person of influence wanting to help an ailing nation return to a less volatile path. The remarks from Graham on this subject help the reader to see the importance of the election of 1968 from an angle beyond that of mere politics and reveals the importance of making the transition from the LBJ administration to that of his successor as smooth as possible. That smooth transition and the growing relationship between LBJ and Nixon proved to be the most interesting part as it sheds new light on why the events of Nixon’s first term unfolded as they did and suggests LBJ’s role up until his death may have been more critical to the Nixon administration than previously thought.\nThe layout of the book is particularly effective in building the story in a way that makes the complex easily digestible. The three sections of the book allow the reader to become acquainted with the backstory of the involved parties before moving on to the campaign and election of 1968. Through new research and personal interviews, the section on the Bombing Halt and Anna Chennault puts to bed the old myth that the Nixon campaign prevented LBJ from attaining peace in Vietnam while in office.\nFor those who have not yet studied the politics of the election of 1968, and for those who thought they knew all there was to know, this book is a must read. It adds depth and clarity to a period of U.S. history that was very complex and pivotal, and does so in a way that a researcher and an armchair historian can both use and enjoy. This work will be a key reference on the topic for decades to come.\nMichael W. Cotten, M.A.\nHistorical Research Consultant",

While it may sound like the premise for an unlikely summer political thriller, this is only one of the many surprises Professor Luke Nichter reveals for the first time in his latest ground-breaking book, The Year That Broke Politics.\n\n“So much of what passes for history today is not based on rigorous research. Too often it is based on preconceived ideas… We should demand better”. With that, one might expect a history that is as interesting as watching paint dry. However, Nichter offers a clear and very engaging look at one of the most interesting presidential election campaigns in the last 150 years that, while deeply researched and copiously footnoted, is very accessible for the most casual of readers. And most importantly, steers free of “preconceived ideas”. What you may learn will be surprising!\n\nNichter’s new scholarship disrupts the conventional “what we think we know”. We get new answers to questions like, what is the untold reason Johnson did not seek a second term? What was Hanoi really after at the Paris Peace Talks? Did, in fact, Richard Nixon maliciously torpedo a Vietnam War peace deal to coldly steal the election? Was Humphrey destined to lose the election? How is it that an unlikely and unsuccessful third-party candidate from the Deep South shapes today’s political landscape? (And while today’s pundits compare Trump to Nixon, is Trump really the benefactor of that near-forgotten third player?) What about that shared secret between the politicians and the evangelist?\n\nWhile not a summer novel, the reader will be just as intrigued with this very readable page-turner of a history.",

Thoroughly researched, and documented, with access to materials never before examined mainly from the archives of the Reverend Billy Graham, it sets much of the conventional wisdom on the election of 1968 and the infamous Chennault Affair at the end of the campaign on its head.\nThe book leads you through the election and the important role that Lyndon Johnson played behind the scenes , often at odds with the very advisors he had on the ground in Paris, who were working diligently, not so much for peace in Vietnam, but in a full scale effort to prevent a Richard Nixon Presidency.\nThe book paints riveting portraits of Lyndon Johnson, a President trying to preserve and enhance his legacy, a populous candidate in George Wallace who spoke for millions bluntly about the perceived mismanagement of Governmental policy at home and abroad, and the two leading Presidential Candidates, Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon who were deadlocked in a battle for the very future of the country, with the most divisive war in a century as the backdrop. It is a moment in history with the most parallels to now, with lessons we can certainly learn from for today and into the immediate future. I cannot recommend this book enough for the real story of that fateful year.",

That is because Trumpism is overtaking the Republican Party and will mount a vigorous comeback, potentially in the hands of a savvier successor—The Next Trump.\n\nThis prophecy will come true, according to Miles Taylor, if we do not learn the lessons of the recent past.\n\nWith the 2024 election approaching, the formerly “Anonymous” official is back with bombshell revelations and a sobering national forecast. Through interviews with dozens of ex-Trump aides and government leaders, Taylor predicts what could happen inside “Trump 2.0,” the White House of a more competent and more formidable copycat.\n\nWhat sounds like a political thriller—from shadowy presidential powers and CIA betrayals to angry henchmen and assassination plots—is instead America’s political reality, as Taylor uses untold stories to shed light on the ex-President’s unfulfilled plans, the dark forces haunting our civic lives, and how we can thwart the rise of extremism in the United States.\n\nBlowback is also a surprisingly emotional and self-critical portrait of a dissenter, whose own unmasking provides a vivid warning about what happens when we hide the truth from others and, most importantly, ourselves.",

We are given a clear and frank warning about what will happen should Trump or someone like Trump get elected as President again. It is as scary as any thriller you could read. The story takes us into meetings in the Oval office, who said what, and who were the adults in the room that were pushing back on Trump's demands. Many of those demands were illegal, such as sending the US military into Mexico to bomb the drug cartels. Taylor also writes about the repercussions for his writing the Op Ed in the NYT, and his first book 'A Warning'. He lived in fear, frequently having to move from place to place as Trump supporters were hunting him looking to take retribution. He often questioned whether he should stand up and speak out, it was a dilema with serious consequences whatever he chose to do. Pointing out that America is so close to losing it's democracy, Taylor encourages us all to stand up and speak out and push back on the lies at every opportunity. Blowback is a great read. It is not difficult for anyone outside of politics to understand. It is straight, to the point, and a book everyone who cares about democracy should read.",

        "comment": "Miles Taylor has done a good job in writing this criticism of Donald Trump based on his personal experience in the administration (including as chief of staff at DHS). He also interviewed many people who worked in the Trump administration and has incorporated their experiences here. Previously, he had become the \"Anonymous\" source of a New York Times op/ed describing himself as part of an inside \"resisstance\" to some of Trump's \"worst impulses\". (What he actually described was more \"constraint\" than a \"Resistance\" and the unfortunate choice of words drew quite a lot of criticism at the time--in addition to a \"hunt\" for the identity of \"Anonymous\" by the White House.)\n\nTaylor was reluctant to deal with the personal attacks that he knew would accompany going public as a critic, but after he left the administration, he did so with his first book. \"Blowback\" is much like a sequel to that one, covering some of the same ground, adding new details, and providing new concerns about the ability of our democracy to withstand a new onslaught. Taylor reviews many of the failings he encounterd in Trump's White House and makes this book a warning--not only about what Donald Trump could do to democracy and national security in a second term, but--almost more important--what a successor who inherits his mantle (but, Taylor imagines, is smarter and more ideologically committed) could do. It's a fast read, with a lot of good information that is easy to have already forgotten about. It could be a good gift for the right person, including someone with a short memory.",

He is a hero.\n\nThe lesson or take-away from both this book and his previous one (A Warning) is that we cannot ignore what is happenning, get our news from non-news outlets, and certainly not via social media. We all must be aware, involved, and most of all, exercise our right to vote.\n\nI want to wish Miles and the other brave Americans who have come forward to confront the right wing extremism in our country the best of luck, and the fortitude to continue this fight, in good health, and devoid of fear. I and like-minded others cheer when we see him do an op-ed, book, podcast or TV appearance.\n\nGodspeed, Miles. You are not just articulate, handsome and brave, you are a part of America's salvation.",

        "comment": "From the first page to the last I was drawn into the story. We thought we knew a lot about what went on in the Trump administration, but that was only a small percent of just how bad Trump is and just how close we came to losing our democracy. It isn't over by a longshot, but this is an eye opening view of how a narcissistic psychopath with the emotion level of a teenager who is rude, disingenuous, odious, vile, and impatient who thinks nothing of hurling demeaning, vituperate and insulting comments to his staff and administration operates on a day to day basis. I followed Anonymous on Twitter and I was shocked when I found out who it was and how high up he was and I am so glad he had the balls to step up to the plate and share his information. Resisting will be needed until every last Trump Maga is voted out of office and Trump is held accountable for his crimes! Thank you Miles, for all you did.",

        "comment": "Years from now when newer history books are available for our grandchildren's children in school, they may ask how we elected as man such as the 45th president. How did we allow someone who really didn't have an interest in the rule of law, the Constitution, morality, empathy, no foreign government experience, etc. hold the highest office in the land. From the beginning his hatred for immigrants was astounding. Imagine, the president of the United States talking about shooting desperate people in the legs just for the desire to live a better life. Seeking asylum is not illegal. The author talks about the next Trump, which may be the same Trump. If that unfortunate event happens, his presidency will just be a continuation of his first, but rife with vengeance and more chaos. Those who are on the fence, read Miles Taylor's book as he not only struggled with the dark character of a man who didn't have anyone's interests before his, but those who follow him in spite of it. Highly recommended. Read it now.",

    "synopsis": "From the team that brought you The Obstacle Is the Way and Ego Is the Enemy, a daily devotional of Stoic meditations—an instant Wall Street Journal and USA Today Bestseller.\n\nWhy have history's greatest minds—from George Washington to Frederick the Great to Ralph Waldo Emerson, along with today's top performers from Super Bowl-winning football coaches to CEOs and celebrities—embraced the wisdom of the ancient Stoics? Because they realize that the most valuable wisdom is timeless and that philosophy is for living a better life, not a classroom exercise.\n\nThe Daily Stoic offers 366 days of Stoic insights and exercises, featuring all-new translations from the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the playwright Seneca, or slave-turned-philosopher Epictetus, as well as lesser-known luminaries like Zeno, Cleanthes, and Musonius Rufus. Every day of the year you'll find one of their pithy, powerful quotations, as well as historical anecdotes, provocative commentary, and a helpful glossary of Greek terms.\n\nBy following these teachings over the course of a year (and, indeed, for years to come) you'll find the serenity, self-knowledge, and resilience you need to live well.",

Some of these types of books give you one or two good ones and the rest are crap but this one has been great so far. It starts with a little blurb by a well known stoic and then the explanation follows. We’ll worth it.",
