    "synopsis": "STOP TRYING TO OUT-CRAZY THE CRAZIES!Lately, we’ve been hearing a lot about things “escalating” – in a bad way: Disagreements between friends and lovers escalate into screaming matches and threats, iffy investments and bad bets escalate into financial ruin, crazy conspiracies escalate into an attempt to overthrow the United States government…One way or another, we have fallen victim to “escalation of commitment” – better known as EOC.We are hard-wired to make mountains out of molehills, pour gasoline on a fire, spiral out of control, go over the edge, cross the line, and say things better left unsaid.And, like lemmings racing over a cliff, we seem almost fated to go too far. Despite reason and common sense telling us to quit while we’re ahead, to cut our losses, to get out while we can, something keeps us escalating the crazy. We just step on the gas and speed up the irrational.EOC is pervasive, insidious. From the decisions we make in our personal lives and careers to those made by businesses, organizations, and nations. EOC rules. At best, if we’re lucky, maybe reality sets in (hopefully), but only after tremendous investments have been squandered – or irreparable damage has been done.Fortunately, EOC can be avoided – even stopped.By understanding specific EOC motivations and effective strategies to diminish them, more effective decision-making can result. With this in mind, Braking Point offers a detailed look at why we often get swallowed up in EOC scenarios and how we can avoid them. It’s an essential resource for anyone looking to enhance their decision-making capabilities in any area of their life.",

    "synopsis": "#1 New York Times Bestseller“THIS. This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more—it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. I’ve never felt so hopeful about what I don’t know.”—Brené Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to LeadThe #1 New York Times bestselling author of Originals, Give and Take,and the forthcoming Hidden Potential examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in lifeIntelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become.Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.",

        "comment": "In 1933, the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that “the fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.” While this is just as true today as it was in the early twentieth-century, the problem actually runs deeper; almost everyone recognizes arrogance and overconfidence in others—but never in themselves.\n\nSince the time of Russell, what’s become known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect has been experimentally validated. Research shows—and personal experience confirms—that those who are the least knowledgeable in a subject tend to be the ones who overestimate their own knowledge and abilities, while those that are full of doubt know enough about the topic to better gauge the extent of their ignorance.\n\nAnd so the telltale sign of a lack of knowledge is, paradoxically, arrogance and overconfidence, whereas in those with actual expertise you often see the opposite: humility, doubt, and open-mindedness.\n\nFar more people fall on the side of overconfidence. This is due, at least in part, to widespread access to the internet, where people can quickly read articles and watch videos (of varying quality and credibility) on any conceivable topic, creating the impression that one has attained deep knowledge in a subject when only a very superficial understanding has been gained.\n\nOvercoming this unfortunate state of affairs is the subject of organizational psychologist Adam Grant’s latest book, Think Again, which seeks to show us how to overcome our own unjustified overconfidence by developing the habits of mind that force us to challenge our own beliefs and, when necessary, to change them.\n\nGrant begins by telling us that when we think and talk, we often slip into the mindset of three distinct professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians. We become preachers when the unwarranted strength of our convictions compels us to convert others to our way of thinking; prosecutors when our sole aim is to discredit the beliefs of others; and politicians when we seek to win favors from our chosen constituency.\n\nWhat all of these mindsets have in common is the assumption that our beliefs are infallible, and that no one could possibly have anything to teach us. Trapped in the prison cell of our own dogma, we don’t set out to learn anything or update our own beliefs; our job is simply to convert others to our way of thinking because, of course, we are right.\n\nThese habits of mental imprisonment can happen to anyone at any level of knowledge or experience, and intelligence itself has actually been shown at times to be a disadvantage, as those with high IQs have the most difficulty updating their beliefs. As Dunning himself said, “The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don’t know you’re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.” You may think all of your beliefs are correct (otherwise you wouldn’t hold them), but there is little doubt that at least some (probably many) of them are false or oversimplified. If your mind remains closed, you’ll never discover which of these beliefs require updating.\n\nThe key question, then, is this: If most of us are unaware of the extent of our own ignorance, how can we hope to overcome our own resistance to change?\n\nThe first step, as Grant recommends, is to detach your sense of self from any specific beliefs. If you identify with a specific set of fixed core beliefs, you will be far less likely to change your mind in the face of new evidence or better reasoning.\n\nGrant recommends instead to ground your sense of self in mental flexibility, taking pride in the fact that you’re willing to change your mind and update your beliefs. To achieve this, you must consider all of your beliefs to be provisional hypotheses and then seek to disprove them, in the process becoming more knowledgeable by being wrong more often. Using this approach, you will have discovered the ideal mindset for personal development and learning—not the mindset of a preacher, prosecutor, or politician, but the mindset of a scientist.\n\nThe scientist, Grant tells us, has one overarching concern: the truth. The individual that adopts a scientific mindset will be equally motivated to challenge their own beliefs as the beliefs of others, testing hypotheses against the evidence and continually updating their beliefs in the process.\n\nOf course, as Grant points out, being an actual practicing scientist does not guarantee the adoption of this mindset. There are plenty of dogmatic scientists that don’t abide by the principles of their own training. The scientific mindset is not, as Grant is describing it, the mindset adopted by scientists necessarily, but rather the ideal mindset that follows the principles of science as an open-ended pursuit of knowledge that is constantly updated in the face of new evidence.\n\nIn one interesting study described by Grant (the book is filled with fascinating examples and studies of a similar sort), two groups of entrepreneurs were provided training. One group was taught the principles of scientific thinking while the control group was not. The researchers found that the scientific-thinking group “brought in revenue twice as fast—and attracted customers sooner, too.” As Grant wrote:\n\n“The entrepreneurs in the control group tended to stay wedded to their original strategies and products. It was too easy to preach the virtues of their past decisions, prosecute the vices of alternative positions, and politick by catering to advisers who favored the existing direction. The entrepreneurs who had been taught to think like scientists, in contrast, pivoted more than twice as often.”\n\nIndividuals that enjoy the prospect of being wrong—and so expand their knowledge more often—tend to be more successful and tend to hold more accurate, nuanced beliefs. It’s not that they lack confidence, it’s that their confidence is of a different nature. Flexible-minded individuals have confidence in their ability to learn and to unlearn beliefs that are outdated or are no longer serving them well. Their confidence lies in their ability to change and to adapt rather than in strength of their convictions concerning any single set of beliefs. As Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman put it, “Being wrong is the only way I feel sure I’ve learned anything.”\n\nThere is definitely a line to walk, and the reader may wonder just how far they should take this advice. To constantly question every one of your beliefs would result in paralyzing doubt. Sometimes, it is the strength of our convictions that give us the energy and perseverance to pursue and accomplish our goals. So this is surely a balancing act, and while we all have to find the sweet spot between timidity and arrogance, conviction and doubt, there is little question that too many of us tend toward the extreme of overconfidence.\n\nAfter showing us how to become better rethinkers ourselves, in the second part of the book we learn how to open other people’s minds. Grant shows us how world-class debaters win debates, how a black musician talked white supremicists out of their bigoted views, and how doctors persuaded anti-vaxxers to get their children immunized.\n\nIn every case, we learn the same lesson in the art of persuasion: to change someone else’s mind, you have to help them find their own internal motivation to change.\n\nThis is not easy. The mindsets we typically slip into tend to have the opposite effect. Act as a preacher, and people will resist being told what to think (even if the facts are on your side). Act as a prosecutor, and people will resent your condescension and will become further entrenched in their original views. Act as a politician, and you’re just saying what you think people want to hear.\n\nNone of these approaches are effective as tools of persuasion. It turns out that your best bet is to adopt, once again, the mindset of a scientist—and to try to get others to do the same. This will transform disagreements from battles to be won and lost into a collaborative pursuit of the truth.\n\nThe most skilled negotiators, debaters, and persuaders all use similar tactics: they first find common ground and points of agreement, ask more questions to get the other person thinking deeper, present a limited number of stronger points, and introduce complexity into the topic to move the person’s thinking away from black-and-white and into shades of gray.\n\nIt turns out that complexifying the issue is always key. Most people exhibit what psychologists call binary bias, or the “basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories.” If you can show people—through the use of skillful questioning—that the topic they think they understand deeply (Dunning-Kruger Effect) is actually far more complex than they originally thought with more than two distinct positions, then you can plant the seeds of doubt that eventually lead to real change.\n\nOne example Grant uses is climate change. We tend to think that people fall into one of two categories—climate-deniers or alarmists—when in fact there are six distinct positions people can take from dismissive, doubtful, or disengaged to cautious, concerned, or alarmed—with shades of nuance in between. It’s often the recognition of this complexity that can get people talking and engaged in productive debate.\n\nIn the final part of the book, Grant shows us how to use the skills of rethinking to engage in more productive political debates, to become better teachers, and to create more innovative cultures at work. Grant provides a host of compelling examples, but my favorite is the middle-school history teacher who gets her students to think like scientists by rewriting textbook chapters that failed to cover important historical events in sufficient depth. Her students pick a time period and topic that interests them and then, through independent research, rewrite the textbook chapter, in the process cultivating the skill to always question what they read. This is a far better approach than simply delivering a lecture and forcing students to regurgitate the information on a test.\n\nBertrand Russell was once asked in an interview if he was willing to die for any of his beliefs. His response was this: “Of course not. After all, I may be wrong.”\n\nIt’s a shame that most people adopt the opposite attitude, and Grant’s latest book will go a long way to remedying this. Think Again is a timely exploration of the importance of humility and the capacity to rethink your own positions while helping others do the same.\n\nBut in the spirit of the book—and to “complexify” the topic—it’s worth considering when displaying doubt and humility might actually backfire. Grant wonders this himself, and points out, for example, that displays of doubt and humility have been shown to have negative effects in the workplace in those who have not already established their competence. It can also be less effective when delivering a presentation to an already sympathetic audience. Does Grant downplay the frequency of these types of situations?\n\nAnother area where excessive doubt and humility might backfire is an area that Grant fails to consider in much depth at all: arguing with bad faith actors. When discussing politics, Grant seems to assume that in most cases both sides are equally motivated by the truth, and that each side has simply failed to understand the complexity of the topic or the merits of the other side.\n\nBut we know that this is not always the case. In politics, people have a host of motives when arguing that sometimes have very little to do with the truth: the desire for power, money, influence, and sometimes simply the desire to offend and get a rise out of people. Grant does not cover how to handle these situations—or how to identify them—and it is highly unlikely that the tactics of the book will work in these situations.\n\nAdditionally, it seems that the masses respond better to confidence when electing political representatives, because we know that Trump was not elected based on his knowledge or competence—and certainly not on his humility.\n\nWhen dealing with bad faith actors, perhaps a good strategy would be to start with a simple question, one Grant mentions in the book: “What evidence would change your mind?” If the answer is “nothing,” then it’s probably best to walk away. Either way, a chapter or section on bad faith actors and the questions you can ask to identify them would have been a welcome addition to the book.\n\nBut of course, this book is not the final word on the topic, and Grant wouldn’t want it to be. As we gain better evidence and more experience, it’s our responsibility to continually rethink and update our beliefs. As Russell said, “If you’re certain of anything, you’re certainly wrong, because nothing deserves absolute certainty.”",

        "comment": "The author, Adam Grant, is a professor of Organizational Psychology at Wharton, with a special interest in evidence-based management.\n\nWhen we think of smart people, we usually understand them to be able to deal with complex problems quickly. It is common to presume that if a person has to rethink and unlearn what they know, it is because they aren’t that smart, and didn’t think well enough in the first place.\n\nThe thrust of this book is the demonstration that there are two cognitive skills that matter more than any others: the ability to rethink and unlearn.\n\nConsider this: You have just completed a multiple-choice test, and you have enough time left to review your work. When you come across an answer that you are not sure is correct, would you change it or leave it? (Pause for your instinctive answer.) Research indicates that ¾ of all people feel it will hurt their score to change. Research also shows that they would have been right to change their answer, but chose to stick to their first opinion, their existing answer. Only ¼ would have been wrong to change the answer they selected.\n\nThis is called the ‘first instinct fallacy.’\n\nPeople seem quite willing to change many parts of their lives, such as their wardrobe or kitchen. However, we are unwilling to change deeply held knowledge or opinions.\n\nThe reason for this is that changing deeply held knowledge or opinions threatens our identity, our understanding of who we are. I am a capitalist, I am a member of this faith, I only use alternative medicine, and so on. We are inclined to hold on to beliefs for the comfort of conviction, rather than the discomfort of doubt.\n\nGrant was part of Harvard’s first online social network. It connected freshmen before university started, and one in eight of the large intake, participated. When they started university, they abandoned the network and shut it down. The well-learnt view was that online tools connect people far away, not when you live in walking distance from each other.\n\nFive years later Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook on the same campus. This experience caused “rethinking to become central to my sense of self,” Grant explains.\n\nHow does rethinking happen? People with ‘super smart’ or ‘regular’ intelligence have all the tools they need for rethinking. The challenge is remembering to use them. If one needs any incentive to take this valuable skill to heart today, here are some medical statistics.\n\nIn 1950 it took 10 years for medical knowledge to double. By 1980 it was doubling every 7 years, and by 2010, every 3.5 years. Clearly medicine is not the only field growing at this rate.\nPhilip Tetlock (author of ‘Super-Forecasting’, reviewed in this column) has a useful description of the mindsets we tend to slip into, to avoid rethinking ideas.\nThe first is the “Preacher”. When our ‘sacred’ beliefs are in jeopardy, we ‘deliver sermons’ to protect and promote our ideals. Changing our minds would be a mark of moral weakness.\nThe second is the “Prosecutor” which entails recognizing the flaws in the other person’s position, and marshalling arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. By ‘prosecuting’ others who are wrong, we ensure we are not persuaded, and so don’t have to admit defeat.\nThe third is the “Politician” where the outcome we desire is winning over an audience, and we will change position in response to what is more popular.\nThe correct and most valuable mindset is that of the “Scientist” because it is a sign of intellectual integrity. The scientist mindset shifts when shown sharper logic and stronger data. It doesn’t see learning as a way to affirm our beliefs, but rather, (and this is so important,) to evolve our beliefs. I cannot think of any professional activity that would not be enhanced by this stance. This is not capitulation: it is the evolution of your opinion and belief.\nIt is easy to see the value of the scientific approach from research on startups. Unschooled in the scientific mindset, the control group averaged less than $300 in annual revenues. The group taught scientific thinking, averaged more than $12,000 in revenues.\nGrant raises the question as to whether mental horsepower guarantees mental dexterity. The unequivocal answer is no. In fact, it has been shown to be liability.\nA study of American presidents was undertaken to identify one trait that could consistently predict presidential greatness - controlling for years in office, wars, and scandals. What emerged was “their intellectual curiosity and openness.” All the presidents who contributed significantly to the country, were interested in hearing new views and revising their old ones. They may have been ‘politicians’ by profession, but they solved ‘problems’ like scientists.\nThis is as true in business. In 2004, a group of Apple engineers, designers, and marketers tried to persuade Steve Jobs to adapt the best-selling product at the time, the iPod, into a phone. Jobs was strongly against dealing with mobile data and voice suppliers because they imposed constraints on the manufacturers of cellphones. After six months of discussion with Jobs, he agreed to the development of the iPod so it could have calling capacity. Four years after it launched, the iPhone accounted for half of Apple’s revenue.\nIn a US - China study of the leadership characteristics of the most productive and innovative teams, it was found that they were not run either by confident leaders or humble leaders. Rather, they were run by leaders with high levels of confidence and with humility. This combination results in the leader having faith in their strengths, but being keenly aware of their weaknesses.\nGreat discoveries don’t start with a high five and a shout of Eureka! Rather they start with \"that's funny...\"\nRay Dalio, founder of the extraordinarily successful hedge fund, Bridgewater, remarked: “If you don’t look back at yourself and think, ‘Wow, how stupid I was a year ago,’ then you haven't learned much in the last year.”\nReading Grant’s book will assist.\n\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High -+--- Low\nPractical High ---+- Low\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on strategy and implementation, is the author of ‘Strategy that Works’ and a public speaker.

Once you understand emotional intelligence, you can see the people around you who have it, and those who don't: at work, in politics, in the media and in your neighborhood.\n\nEmotional Intelligence: Why it is Crucial for Success in Life and Business by James W. Williams is a quick read that introduces the basic concepts regarding emotional intelligence. Useful nuggets of information are to be found within the pages, but it’s far from an authoritative read.

    "synopsis": "This accessible guide expands upon the “well-written, cogent, and useful” (David Allen, author of Getting Things Done) bestselling Building a Second Brain with actionable advice on how to improve your digital life in just a few minutes.Living a modern life requires juggling a ton of information. But we were never taught how to manage this information effectively so that we can find what we need when we need it. In The PARA Method, Tiago Forte outlines a simple and intuitive four-step system that will help us sort all the information flooding our brains into four major categories—Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives—allowing us to manage our commitments while achieving our goals and dreams. -Projects are specific, short-term efforts that you are actively working on with a certain goal in mind, such as completing a website or renovating your bathroom. -Areas are the larger, ongoing areas of responsibility (health, finances, etc.) that encompass those specific projects. -Resources include content on a range of topics you’re interested in or that could be useful for your projects and areas. -Archives include anything from the previous three categories that is now inactive, but you want to save for future reference. With his easy-to-understand and engaging voice, Forte outlines his best practices and tips on how to successfully implement PARA, along with deep dives on everything from how to adopt habits to stay organized to how to use this system to enhance your focus. The PARA Method can be implemented in just seconds but has the power to transform the trajectory of your work and life using the power of digital organization.",

        "comment": "I've been a productivity junkie for years. Ever since reading \"Getting Things Done\" 10 years ago, I have fine tuned my productivity system to safely capture every useful item that pops into my brain for later. I'm constantly adapting my tools and methods each year to improve efficiency and adapt to my lifestyle. While this has been useful, I've always felt trapped by the overwhelming amount of content I had, constantly worried I wasn't focusing on the right thing or that I was missing important information. Embracing the PARA method and the mindset behind it has completely eliminated these anxieties.\n\nThe PARA method encourages you to spend the most time on the most important (or \"actionable\") content, and less time on the less relevant content. It focuses on organizing information as quickly as possible for action, not on organizing as an end in itself. This results in a clean system with the most relevant information close-at-hand that takes minimal time to set up and maintain.\n\nNow that I've incorporated the PARA method, I am excited and energized by my projects and their possibilities in a way I haven't felt in years. It has given me a way not only to organize my own thoughts, but also to organize and collaborate on projects with my wife and team at work in a better, streamlined way.\n\nThe book is also the most clear, concise productivity book I've read to date (and I've read a lot of them). While the genre is prone to have books full of extra fluff with little value, The PARA Method is a meaty, concise overview of the most relevant information written in a clear, pragmatic way. I had to exercise restraint with my highlighting, which would have just highlighted every word from beginning to end if I wasn't careful.\n\nOverall, this is a great book for those new to productivity methods as well as for old productivity pros. The PARA method offers a unique insight that is freeing and will help you to have peace of mind and be more productive. I am recommending this book to everyone I know.",

This could easily be read prior to his other book, Building a Second Brain, but on its own it is a useful, straight-forward process for organizing digital material that doesn't require complex hierarchies, decimal systems, or dates. I liked best the idea of digital bankruptcy: essentially the digital equivalent of taking everything on your desk and sweeping it into a drawer (as opposed to the trash) so that you have a clean workspace to move current projects forward. The stuff is still there, if you need it again (you probably won't) but it is no longer stopping you from getting to work.",

It works. And it will work for you.Not that long ago though, my business had gotten so bad that I literally couldn’t even give my services away for free. At the end of each month, I would look at my bank account hoping to see progress (but there wasn’t). I knew something had to change...but what?Over the next 48 months, I went from losing money to making $36 for every $1 spent. In that time period, we generated over $120,000,000 across four different industries: service, e-commerce, software, and brick & mortar.But, unlike everyone else, we didn’t have great funnels, great ads, or a wealthy niche. In fact, we didn’t even send emails until we had crossed $50M in sales(!). Instead, we were able to do this one thing really well….we created offers so good, people felt stupid saying no.Here’s exactly what this book will show you how to do:How To Charge a Lot More Than You Currently Are…a- The Tiny Market Big Money Process we use to laser focus on niche markets overflowing with cashb- The “Unfair” Pricing formula….how we 100x’d our pricing (and got more people to say yes….for real)c- The Value Flip...so you never get price compared again (that’s a promise)d- The Virtuous Cycle of Price...use it to outspend your competition (for good) while using your product to attract the best talent.How To Make Your Product So Good, Prospects Find A Way To Pay For Ita- The Unbeatable Value Equation….to make what you sell worth more than your prospects have ever receivedb- The Delivery Cube….to make delivering your products and services cost less but provide morec- The Trim & Stack Hack….to maximize profit using the absolute best delivery methods. (This has never been shared publicly and was how we made $17M in profit on $28M in revenue in a year when I was 28 years old).How To Enhance Your Offer So Much, Prospects Buy Without Hesitatinga- The Scarcity Stack….how to use the three different types of scarcity in every offer you make (without lying) to get people to buy the moment you askb- The “Everyday” Urgency Blueprint... to get prospects to buy RIGHT NOW, using everyday life to create real, ethical time pressurec- Unbeatable Bonuses...and watch your prospects' hesitations melt away as they begin reading their credit cards to you before you even finish!d- God-mode Guarantees...so good they make anyone say yes (even people who would never normally consider buying). I’ll show you how to stack and layer all 4 types of guarantees together. I even give you my 13 favorite guarantees word-for-word to swipe for yourself.e- Magic Naming Formula to get the absolute highest response rates and conversion rates from everything you do to get new clients and so much more…The methods contained within this book are so simple, so instantaneous, and so effective, it’s as if they work by magic. If you implement even one tactic in this book, you’ll see the change in your prospects' demeanor. And you’ll know the $100M Offer method worked when you start hearing “What do I need to do to move forward?” ...before you even ask for the sale.If you want to get more prospects to reply to your ads for less advertising dollars and get them to say YES to breathtaking prices...then ADD TO CART, use its contents, and see for yourself.",

        "comment": "$100M Offers is an excellent book in more than one way. First of all, I want to scream from the rooftops how amazing the concept of this book itself is.\n\nI’m in the book advertising business. Long ago (read: a few years back), I noticed how great an opportunity creating books was for business owners. You can sell the book, let people get to know you and your offer, and give them an incentive to go back for more.\n\nI’m an author myself, and I know firsthand how common readers can turn into great customers. Yet, when I tried to explain my concept, very few entrepreneurs got it. And finding an entrepreneur who not only understood it, but implemented it in the right way, is as hard as trying to find a unicorn.\n\nAlex Hormonzi is a unicorn, and then some.\n\nHe didn’t just write a book to lure readers and turn them into customers. He wrote a book, so they could grow their businesses to even qualify as his prospects! This is my concept taken to another level. And the execution was flawless too.\n\nNo Weak Points\nI couldn’t see any CONS of $100M Offers. This book is just great. Short, to the point, yet incredibly meaty.\n\nLike very few books I read, it was written with the specific goal in mind and it sticks to this agenda rigidly. The book also reads very well. It’s written in plain English. It’s extremely quotable. And the how-to in the book is pure gold.\n\nPROS\n$100M Offers has many advantages. I will just highlight several points that caught my attention.\n\n1. Amazing Business Book.\nAs I said – pure gold. This book is packed full with so many business tips. I’m a half-time entrepreneur and my business is miniscule. I’m faraway from making $3M to qualify as Alex’s prospect. Yet, I learned a lot. I’m in a better position to close the gap between where I am now (a way below $100k) and being prospect-worthy for Alex.\n\nAnd that’s the proof of his idea. Alex published a book. A guy in faraway Poland read it, heard about him, loved his content, and got to know him as a person.\n\nNow, I have much better chances to ever make $3M. And Alex increased his chances to get a new client in the future. And he made 33 cents (the Kindle royalties) in the process. 😀\n\nAs a greenhorn, I got the most out of Sections II and III. I got the feeling in which kind of business I am and which type of entrepreneur I am.\n\nThe most impactful business advice for me? Here:\n\"No one can serve two masters.(…)”\n\n“If you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money.”\n\nIntellectually, I’ve known for a long time I need to niche down. I was just too lazy to ever try. I like doing many things.\n\nBut I’m a way below the $10M cap, and I definitely could’ve used more money. Right here, right now.\n\n2. Business Philosophy Close to My Heart.\nAlex is a way better entrepreneur than me. Yet, the principles he teaches are the principles I live by. I guess this is why this book made so much sense for me.\n\n\"Some people get there slowly. But everyone gets there eventually, as long as you don’t give up.”\n\nPerseverance is a key to success. And I’m definitely the ‘getting there slowly’ guy. I need time to process things. I need time to accommodate to change. But I also never give up. I’m much closer to financial independence now than nine years ago when I published my first book.\n\n\"Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits.”\n\nAmen. Most people easily grasp a need for acquiring skills. Much fewer understand a necessity to change one’s mindset. But acquiring character traits?! This is something so ‘out there’ that people just shrug it off.\n\nHowever, this is how you become an entrepreneur and grow as one. 10 years ago, I was an ordinary employee. I never had led even one person in my life. When I realized I need to own a business to reach a lifestyle I desired, I also realized I’m the worst possible material for entrepreneurship. Thus, I decided to work on myself, on my character, not skills. In several months, I started making money outside of my day job for the first time in my life. In several years, I started my own business. Now, my team consists of seven people working for me regularly and a few contractors.\n\nI couldn’t made it if I started from acquiring skills.\n\n3. Personal Approach.\nAlex starts his book from a gut-wrenching personal story. While I never experienced such an enormous pressure like him – I am way too risk-averse to bet everything I own on my business – I could easily relate. He won me by this story.\n\n\"Entrepreneurship is a crazy rollercoaster. I dipped into my savings to pay my people or business bills all too often. I had business disasters (my blog was hacked; twice) and unexpected business opportunities (people reaching out to me out of the blue to buy my services).”\n\nThe author skillfully sprinkled his personal stories throughout the book. They took very little volume of the book, but they are very memorable.\n\nI remembered best the one close to the end, when Alex described how he felt, when he finally got over $100,000 in his personal account. Quoting him:\n\n\"Tens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life.”\n\n4. Money Mindset.\nNow, there are many experts on business tactics and strategies. There are very few experts on shaping one’s money mindset to earn s*it loads of money.\n\n\"Making s*it loads of money breaks people’s minds.”\n\nPersonally, it breaks my mind to make more than 98% of my country population. I struggle to grow my business because I have ‘it all.’ I definitely can rub off some abundance mindset from Alex.\n\nHe very smartly explained why entrepreneurs should charge so much that it hurts. Thanks to $100M Offers I’m slowly stretching my money mindset, charging 2-6 times more than I had charged.\n\n5. Excellent Detailed Advice.\nHave I mentioned the nitty-gritty advice? Just one example:\n\n10x to 1/10th test.\n\n\"If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that?”\n\nWow, talking about stretching your mind! And this is just a single exercise out of dozens instanced in the book.\n\n6. Amazing Quotes.\nAlex definitely has the gift of words. Just a sample of powerful quotes from $100M Offers:\n\n\"Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.”\n\nGreat authors have great ability to describe reality. Drop mic. It also gave me a moment of reflection upon the human condition. This is reality. We suffer. We have always suffered, and always will. Like almost everything, it has bad aspects (hurt) and good ones – like endless opportunities to alleviate our neighbors’ sufferings.\n\n\"The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.”\n\nThis helped me realize why I’m still in the business. I always have had an upper hand. I do not care for my prospects’ ‘yes.’ After a few years, I exactly know with whom I want to work. Definitely, I don’t want to work with authors who cannot trust me.\n\n\"Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time.”\n\nSo succinct. So aptly said. Two greatest sales functions described in a dozen words.\n\nSummary\nDo you want to grow your company to $3M-$50M? You will not get a better textbook on that subject than $100M Offers. And you will get it for just 99 cents.\n\nThis is an absolute no-brainer. It’s also the no-brainer for anyone remotely interested in business in general. You cannot get a better education for a smaller fee than this book.",

        "comment": "Writing specifically to other members of a phenotype that is not uncommon: Folks that are competent, ambitious, and/or intelligent, but who either suck at sales and marketing or have been trained by their environment to have an \"ick\" factor around either or both.\n\nWhat Hormozi does exceptionally well is provide precise, tangible tools and frameworks that can immediately be applied to a broad range of business contexts. While he made his name in fitness, he has applied these frameworks effectively to grow service businesses (consultancies), consumer products, and software businesses. As I've been going through, I've been testing how these might apply both to organizations that I am a part of as a member of the leadership and organizations I consult to as a strategic / technical advisor...and I'm finding direct applications.\n\nThe most bang for buck in my book are the two driving frameworks he provides:\n1. How do define and value your market\n2. How to define the value you provide for that market\n\nDownstream of those two frameworks is everything important for a business owner - understanding how to bring people to your doorstep, how to make them excited to purchase products or services from you, and how to ensure that they are so happy with those products or services that they become an advocate and evangelist for what you do.\n\nHe has earned my trust by applying one of his own guiding concepts directly within the book - if you can characterize and describe a prospect's problem more effectively than anybody else in the market, they will trust that you can also provide a better solution than anybody else in the market. While the book is applicable to multiple narrow niches, it has applicability to not just the wantreprenur but the STRUGGLING entrepreneur - the entrepreneur who has started one or more businesses but never gotten past the point of being a slave to their business. Alex illustrates exactly why and how this happens (it comes down to the predictable, nigh-unavoidable consequences of trying to compete purely on price and performance without differentiation or an exceptional edge), and provides a specific and immediately actionable solution.\n\nThe value in Hormozi's work will come when I apply these to the businesses I work with, but that application will begin immediately, and I am excited to do so. Frankly, he has provided a more tangible and useful framework for getting a business to the $10MM threshold than anything else I've read, and FAR more useful information than everything I learned in my MBA program put together.\n\nSo if you are:\n- reticent to be a marketer\n- somebody who struggles with generating leads / clients for their business, but is able to deliver when given the opportunity to do so\n- somebody who hasn't launched their business because they don't know how they will get people interested, or get people to care\n- somebody who hasn't launched their business because they think they need to solve every problem before they get going\n\nthen this is likely one of the most immediately actionable and valuable books you can read on the topic, and one I would soundly recommend over any of them.\n\nAs a final plus: Alex talks through many of these concepts in detail on Acquisition.com, in a series of courses; while the material is largely redundant (unsurprisingly so), the multiple delivery methods improve retention dramatically.\n\nI will be eagerly looking forward to the next books in his series, and will be immediately purchasing them when they become available. Until that time comes, I'm looking forward to applying these principles across a few different businesses, and feel as confident as I have in a while - albeit with some anxiety, but I would be arrogant or foolish if I did not have that! - that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and operating independent of a large corporation does not mean merely being a slave of a different sort.\n\nExcellent work, Alex, you are an inspiration of the sort rarely encountered in the business world.",

        "comment": "In “The Making of an Expert,” an article that appeared in the July–August 2007 issue of Harvard Business Review, K. Anders Ericsson, Michael J. Prietula, and Edward T. Cokely share several important revelations from decades of research on peak performance. They could not have anticipated (but may have suspected) that one of the concepts, the so-called “10,000” Rule,” would become so widely and so durably misunderstood. In essence, the idea is that if you spend (on average) about 10,000 hours of practice on a sport such as golf, a musical instrument such as a violin, or a game such as chess, you can master the skills needed to become peak performer.\n\nEricsson, Prietula, and Cokely acknowledge the potential value of practice. However, \"Not all practice makes perfect. You need a particular kind of practice—deliberate practice—to develop expertise. When most people practice, they focus on the things they already know how to do. Deliberate practice is different. It entails considerable, specific, and sustained efforts to do something you can’t do well—or even at all. Research across domains shows that it is only by working at what you can’t do that you turn into the expert you want to become.”\n\nAs I began to read this book, I was again reminded of  that article and of \"The Serenity Prayer,\" attributed to Reinhold Niebuhr: \"God, grant me the serenity to accept what I cannot change, the courage to change what I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\" A contemporary of Niebuhr's, Albert Einstein, once suggested that insanity \"is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.\"\n\nGreg Harden is a peak performer among those who help others to achieve and sustain peak performance. He agrees with Niebuhr and Einstein, urging his clients to \"control the controllables\" as well as \"adapt to every possible circumstance\" and \"adjust your thinking based on the changes that confront you.\"\n\nHarden: \"Whether you are seventeen or seventy, there is a child or adolescent in you who needs your love and your acceptance. At the same time, there's an [begin italics] adult [end italics] inside you who needs to understand which attitudes and behaviors are working and which ones are sabotaging your dreams.\n\n\"In the end, the real mission of this book -- my objective, my [begin italics] obsession [end italics] -- is to help you become the world's greatest expert on one subject: yourself.\"\n\nThere are indeed several prominent peak performers that Hagen has advised. More than a dozen of their \"Testimonials\" are strategically placed within his lively narrative. They include:\n\no Tom Brady (football)\no Ann Welch Braun (fundraising)\no Erik Campbell (education)\no Steve Hamilton (author)\no Desmond Howard (football)\no Emily Line (technology)\no Michelle McMahon (volleyball)\no Cooper Marody (hockey)\no Michael Phelps (swimming)\no Jonathan Satovsky (asset management)\n\nEach explains how Harden helped them to become the best person they could be and then become a better one.\n\nHowever different their personalities, circumstances and objectives may be, all of them needed to develop or strengthen a mindset that would enable them to make a best-effort when in training and then in competition...not with others [begin italics] but with themselves [end italics].  It is highly unlikely that you will be able to work one-on-one with Greg Harden.You can, however, absorb and digest the material in this book. Then, apply it effectively however and wherever most appropriate.\n\nHere are two concluding suggestions while reading Stay Sane in an Insane World: Highlight key passages, and, record your comments, questions, action steps (preferably with deadlines), and page references as well as your responses to questions posed and to lessons you have learned. (Pay close attention to the key reminders in introductory head notes and end-of-chapter reminders.) These two simple tactics will facilitate, indeed expedite frequent reviews of key material later.",

        "comment": "This book was honestly a difficult read... I’m a prolific reader, but found myself struggling to stay focused due to format or reading on my bad day... the graphics illustrating his points were extremely helpful, but I did better with video versions of Cliff notes on this actual book that were to the point. Steven Covey is very informative and if anyone heeds him and makes adjustments as suggested, they will benefit greatly and see changes in their life. I’ve personalized his recommendations and it’s working wonders in accomplishing my priority values; one long example is down below.\n\nAs a Christian INFJ, I need to personalize some things while keeping the principles given... for example his scale for determining priorities is a great graphic organizer, but his view on Quadrants 1-4 are extremely different so I personalized them and THAT has been life changing. I do a brain dump and sort into my categories (my A, B, C, and ⭐️‘s). I don’t bother writing down unimportant or tasks that even could be deemed trash or wastes of time so I don’t understand how anyone can recommend you trash things on your list to shorten it... there is NOTHING on my list that I can dump into the trash.\n\nSo my A’s are for Adonai (Lord) and stuff PLANNED out like Bible reading and prayer. Before this book I was STUCK here and no earthly good. Now I LIMIT my time here so I can move on to my second quadrant B’s (human BEINGS especially BELIEVERS) this is the section important to me that will be easily overlooked or dropped due to the busyness and business of life etc... since I’m a caregiver for 3 people my “work” falls here but so does my self care bc I’m a BEING too... when my brother asks if we can meet for DINNER or even just be his company for his task list... yes, is the answer due to RELATIONSHIPS being higher than my mundane chores and yes carry my shopping list always and if I can reduce it while bonding that is excellent! My least important quadrant is all C’s it’s cyclical chores and other routines that SUPPORT smooth living so I cannot dump these but I did set up automatic payments and delegate time consuming chores to reduce and minimize this one as Steven Covey pointed out. All else I am able to use TEAMWORK making even this a BONDING with people time to power through these before they become an urgent crisis as all the mundane things will do if ignored.\n\nMy greatest viewpoint that differs from his though is what I named ⭐️‘s my quadrant 4 is the UNEXPECTED AND UNPLANNED for life “INTERRUPTIONS”... these are actually DIVINE INTERRUPTIONS... moments for me/us to Shine like Stars and interact with PEOPLE we did not plan to and theses instances are far more important than whatever we were up to especially chores or tasks....\n\nExample: We came home from grocery store unloading the car and the person soliciting across the street noticed and yes came over... Ugh 😑 Cable company there’s NO way I’d change to and as I was EXPLAINING that politely... GOD helped me see this was HIS Interruption.... recognizing that changed my whole ATTITUDE and PRIORITY metric instantly and so I began to LISTEN... her job brought her to our house at an inconvenient time for me, but Ariana R. was my prayer answer to making Christmas 2019 MORE Christmas... I tried other ways to connect to people in need during the season, but those fell short of my vision of impact and difference making... I might still send a shoebox or pick a name from a tree I think I can handle or whatever the church plans... but my mom n I talked with Ariana for over 2 hours until the Sun set and we all HUGGED our goodbyes and I had a NEW friend connection.... the groceries were still fine 😎 SO customer service representatives, clerks, servers, drivers, etc. are all ⭐️‘s",

    "synopsis": "Doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important topics.",

        "comment": "From the first sentence to the last, this book provides the latest and most up-to-date evidence for financial literacy's wholesome power to enrich your entire life. The author tells stories to discover financial literacy and living a good life go hand and hand. Most financial books discuss the dominated and respected quantitative side, the sophisticated science, complicated formulas, and mind-numbing statistics. Reading the traditional personal finance genres makes people erroneously think investors need to be intelligent and aggressive to invest successfully.\n\nThe Psychology of Money is courageously different. It is about life first and finances second. Don’t we want to better understand our behavior, our sense of ourselves and what makes us tick so we can achieve that vibrant and contented life? I know I do.\n\nThe author skillfully separates the easy part of discovering the investing process versus the hard part. This may shock newbies, but understanding the quantitative aspect of finances, such as constructing a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, is the easy part. Look, it is not the little guy or gal versus the massively intimating stock market with the macho goal of beating the average returns. Instead, this book is about understanding our behavior and the decisions we make to achieve a balanced and calm life with accepting reasonable stock market returns. Now that’s the hard part! But this author makes understanding our behavior achievable and interesting. He accepts whatever skills, experience, or knowledge readers bring to the table.\n\nThe author brings up an age-old adage that we have been taught by our elders for generations—don’t take things so personally! With life's many challenges and sometimes negative surprises, isn't it about how we react that counts? Instead, if we respond with wisdom gained from our experiences over the long haul, the challenge itself will eventually be insignificant.\n\nThe author explains that our reactive behavior, whether the sudden death of a loved one, a broken water pipe damaging our house, or a stock market crash, how we respond to each of these vastly different crises is no different. As a reviewer of this outstanding book, I took the liberty of interpreting the primary theme with my examples. With the death of a loved one, we can blame the doctors, the hospital, and isolate from friends and family, and sob over beers for the rest of your life as a lonely and bitter widow or widower, or you can blame the stock market, your broker, or valueless Wall Street for your portfolio loses. For example, it is well known that millions of investors reacted negatively for over a decade. They sat out with their two to three trillion of the longest bull market in history because they lost money in the 2008 financial crisis. So, no matter what the experience, isn't it always how we react? This book would help those unfortunate investors pull themselves and their portfolio together to get back in the market.\n\nTo bring mindfulness to our reactions, the author talked about investors' emotions, attitude, and temperament. To be successful in this counterintuitive financial system is to be aware and insightful of this powerful psychological human potential—your expectation of future returns. The Goldilocks Principle doesn't have too high return expectations or too low, but somewhere in between. But what is a reasonable expected return?\n\nThe author reports one of the most significant FACTS of the entire book: The United States Stock Market Returns 6.8% after Inflation. Allow me to repeat, 6.8%.\n\nAccording to the author, our United States capitalistic system produces about 6.8% return minus inflation since the 1870s (3.1% average inflation generates a total return of 9.9%). It is the law of averages, and it is powerful if we know how to tap into it and to be 100% satisfied with average returns (It has been researched many times that too many investors fail to get average returns). Morgan explains how to harness this massive industry and what strategy will get you the average return. The goal is to earn the average return over many years. Why? Two reasons:\n1. 6.8% return over inflation is a great return!\n2. Because our emotions will be spared the negative reactions from the massive swings (volatility) of the stock market which will set you up to panic and “get out.”\n\nThis book will help you find that \"just right\" balance of your investments and your mind so you can sleep soundly with confidence and reach your financial goals over long periods of time. There is no get rich quick scheme. If a financial adviser or your best friend says that they can beat the averages, walk away, and never listen to that nonsense.\n\nHousel encourages all investors by debunking one debilitating myth from the start. All you need to be a successful investor is patience, think long term, and one tiny piece of mathematics, the power of compound interest over decades. You do not need an MBA or a high IQ! In fact, for the newbie financial reader with no financial background or smarts, take heart, you have an advantage. He wrote: \"Ordinary folks with no formal financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.\"\n\nThat's me! I have never taken a financial course in my life. I flunked 2nd grade and I scored a lower than 100 IQ. But I had a huge advantage because I majored in psychology. Knowing how my mind functioned, I mitigated my return expectations of the market and drama during three of the biggest stock market crashes in history. My expectations for growth and losses are reasonable, balanced between stocks and fixed because I knew what the world-wide stock market returns since 1870. With my mind disciplined to stay the course forever and to do what I can do—control the real deal by keeping expenses low and be extremely happy with reasonable returns. I have perfect control by paying myself instead of some Wall Street mucky muck's yacht.\n\nFor years, seasoned investors poo-poo psychology (read the one and two-star reviews of this book). There is at least one huge exception. One of the most significant financial thinkers of the 20th century and the mentor and professor of Warren Buffett. Ben Graham wrote said in the very first paragraph of his monumental 623 page The Intelligent Investor, \"…little will be said here about the technique of analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and investors' attitudes.\" (1973 revised, page 1).\n\nThe author had the great wisdom to cite a book titled “Enough” by the legendary John Bogle. Morgan tells stories of people \"hit it big\" (IN THE BILLIONS!). It wasn’t \"enough.\" They want more, and in the end, they lost it all. Bogle’s most famous quote to get the market averages mentioned previously is to invest in the “entire haystack, do not look for the needle.”\n\nThe author makes an important statement that is long overdue and worth repeating—the qualitative discussions of investing is more complicated than the quantitative discussions. It is humans that make the decisions and do all the trading on the stock exchanges throughout the world. Last I heard, humans have feelings. Housel says that science is exact and is governed by predictable physical laws. Molecules and atoms do not have feelings! But millions of investors do! Sir Isaac Newton would agree. He famously lamented after losing his investments to the South Sea Disaster in the 18th century, \"I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.\" Knowledge of psychology and behavior will help you understand and protect yourself from the \"madness of people.\"\n\nThe author covers a lot of ground because there is a lot of human behavioral and psychological constructs to explain. Luck vs. skill, attitude vs. math, being average vs. being superior, uncertainty vs. certainty, and confidence born from wisdom vs. overconfidence born from recklessness are impossible to measure and explain. The author correctly labeled these constructs “soft skills” (Hard skills are the math, statistics, graphs, and tables). Luck, attitude, accepting average returns, uncertainty, long-term horizon, and overconfidence are difficult to explain without emotional pushback from some investors. Most seasoned investors want to be intelligent, act aggressive, appear confident, and look sophisticated and soft skills will not get them that image and beat the market.\nWe love to think successes originated on skills, knowledge, intelligence, spreadsheets, and math. The most vital reaction to many seasoned investors is downplaying luck to investment success. But Morgan won't have it. Making money from stock and bond investing is being smart with the complicated reality we face, and spreadsheet knowledge will not be enough. That being lucky is part of the equation. He admits that the luck factor is the question that might not be answered in our lifetimes.\n\nIn the meantime, there is nothing wrong with being lucky. The returns are green too. But most seasoned investors feel insulted. Warren Buffett always reports that he is an incredibly fortunate investor born in the United States. I am lucky that I am alive after contracting stage two colon cancer twenty years ago. Any one of us could have been born in a small village in India in abject poverty, a shantytown in Lima, Peru, or one of our country's public housing projects.\n\nUnfortunately, I gave the book four stars. There was one paragraph that does not belong in the book. I was disappointed. I agree that I might be petty, but that paragraph doesn’t make any sense because it doesn’t follow the narrative throughout. On page 218, I rewrote here for those who use the indexing strategy, especially Bogleheads:\n\n“That doesn’t mean index investing will always work. It doesn’t mean it is for everyone. And it doesn’t mean active stock picking is doomed to fail. In general, this industry has become too entrenched on one side or the other—particularly those vehemently against active investing.”\n\nDid the Author Lose His “Psychology” for a Moment?\n\nI scratched my head and seriously wondered, has the author lost his mind? What in the world motivated the author had to write this when he shares how he invests, and it’s just like most Bogleheads and myself invest with low-cost index funds? I believe I can speak for most Bogleheads: of course, we are “vehemently against active investing!” It’s expensive and flawed is thoroughly agreed upon by genuine fiduciary financial advisers. Furthermore, there are books, peer-reviewed academic articles, and the Bogleheads’ forum experiences of how successful the indexing strategy has been overactive management. The author admits on the following page that 85% of active managers fail to beat the averages! The active management strategy has been proven dead for decades, and the author’s stories debunk active management. Over 35 million investors have their seven trillion dollars with Vanguard and TIAA. We know that active managers from Wall Street’s big banks and brokerage firms spend a lot of time sipping martinis on their yachts.\n\nOther than that hideous paragraph, The Psychology of Money is a fine book because it makes a huge contribution to financial discussions and what it means to be financially literate. The qualitative argument of financial literacy is desperately needed in the financial world. The quantitative argument is appropriate for constructing your portfolio and understanding how markets only return 6.8% average for 150 years. I learned a ton by reading those books too. But after that, no amount of math, sophistication, financial engineering, or science will protect investors from a bear market. Only what is between our ears will. Investors must get our heads behind the idea that we are up against a massive industry that wants to use our money to make money for themselves.\nThe industry is playing a totally different game, different motivation, and most important different life values—they spend 24/7 in front of their powerful computers trading for two goals only, bonuses and beating the averages. I have one more example of luck--We are lucky that Morgan Housel wrote this important work. It is not about looking at your finances 24/7, searching for that investment “gem” that will make you rich quickly or to compete. At the end of the day, it is about doing our part in making the world a better place than it is now, being generous to those in need, be part of something bigger than yourself, and spending quality time with family and friends.",

        "comment": "Psycholology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed and Happiness by Morgan Housel is a timeless work about how our feelings, emotions and interactions with money often results in different outcomes for different people – because people are different. So, insights into how to think and behave about money is instructive.\n\nYou may think you don’t have enough money to make a difference for your future. I think this book will show you, how even with those thoughts, that you can.\n\nOthers may believe they have more than enough. Those too are risky thoughts and beliefs.\n\nBecause people are different, everyone should read this book to see what you uniquely learn about yourself and how you should think about money.\n\nChocked full of great insights to guide us all.\n\nQuotes that hit home from various chapters are presented below. There are many more quotes possible, but then you’d miss the message between each quote. I strongly suggest getting the book to see how these below snippets string together into a powerful story about how we think and behave towards money matters.\n\nQuote:\n• Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.\n• Luck and risk are siblings.\n• Yes, but I have something he will never have … enough.\n• There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.\n• The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.\n• $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett’s $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday.\n• Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old.\n• His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That’s how compounding works.\n• But good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild.\n• Getting wealthy vs. staying wealthy.\n• Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another.\n• Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.\n• No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.\n• When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.”\n• Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.\n• Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.\n• Money has many ironies. Here’s an important one: Wealth is what you don’t see.\n• Past a certain level of income people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who don’t think they can save, and those who don’t think they need to save.\n• Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.\n• The value of wealth is relative to what you need.\n• Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.\n• People’s ability to save is more in their control than they might think.\n• Things that have never happened before happen all the time.\n• The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led to tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to [over a trillion dollars] in student loans with [a high percentage of default rates].\n• The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.\n• The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.\n• The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.\n• The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires and goals are likely to change in the future. [Thus, their history of change won’t change anymore into their future].\n• Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.\n• Successful investing looks easy when you’re not the one doing it. Hold stocks for the long run … but do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing?\n• Price … not dollars and cents … it’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty … all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time.\n• Beware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are.\n• When investors have different goals and time horizons – and they do in every asset class – prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the factors those investors pay attention to are different.\n• The interesting thing about [absolutely pessimistic] stories is that their polar opposite – forecasts of outrageous optimism – are rarely taken as seriously as prophets of doom.\n• Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism.\n• …progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.\n• The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.\n• We don’t know what we don’t know.\n• Coming to terms with how much you don’t know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.\n• Less ego, more wealth.\n• If you want to to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.\nUnquote.\n\nThere’s a lot of wisdom alone in the various quotes above. There’s even more wisdom reading how they string together to see the larger story line to understand your psychology of money applied in your own life.\n\nEach person reading Housel’s work will get something different out of it than someone else. And each time you read it (I suggest more than once) you too will get yet still something else out of it.",

Longer training, ever more advanced technologies—neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist. First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third. In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine, from disaster response to investment banking, skyscraper construction, and businesses of all kinds. An intellectual adventure in which lives are lost and saved and one simple idea makes a tremendous difference, The Checklist Manifesto is essential reading for anyone working to get things right.",

        "comment": "The author, Dr Atul Gawande is an American general and endocrine surgeon, and public health researcher. I have been meaning to read and review his book for many years. What a fitting introduction to ‘The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.’\nPhilosophers Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre tackled the issue of why we fail at what we set out to do in the world. One reason, they explain is “necessary fallibility”, a consequence of some things in the world, and our lives, being beyond our understanding and control.\nBut there is much that is not, and yet we fail at these too. Gorovitz and MacIntyre suggest that there are two reasons for this: ignorance and ineptitude (incompetence or clumsiness.)\nFor most of human history, people’s lives have been lived largely in ignorance. However, over the last few decades, science has filled in enough knowledge to make our ‘ineptitude’ as much of a challenge as our ‘ignorance’ was in the past.\nGawande’s context is the ineptitude in medicine. While our knowledge and sophistication has grown enormously, the struggle is still how to deliver on this know-how.\nThe knowing-doing gap is found everywhere. From the frequent mistakes authorities make when disaster strikes, to the legal mistakes our lawyers make that are the result of little more than simple administrative errors.\n“Every day there is more and more to manage and get right and learn,” Gawande points out. With all we are required to manage, failure happens far more often - despite great effort rather than from a lack of it.\nExpertise has been seen as the solution to ineptitude in most areas of work – “they need more training!” and modern medicine has been no different. But capability clearly isn’t our primary difficulty; in most fields training is longer and more intense than ever. In the early twentieth century, you could practice medicine with only a high school diploma and a one-year medical degree. Today doctors have six years of university, and three to seven years of residency to practice paediatrics, surgery, neurology, or the like.\nYet our failures remain frequent, but there is a solution – checklists.\nThough this seems almost ridiculous in its simplicity - especially to those of us who have spent years carefully developing ever more advanced skills - it has proven not to be.\nIn 1935 the US Army was looking for the next generation long-range bomber. Boeing’s aluminium-alloy Model 299 was able to carry five times as many bombs as the army had requested, and could fly faster and farther than previous bombers. The army planned to order at least 65 planes until it stalled on a test flight, turned on one wing, and exploded. The crash, attributed to ‘pilot error, killed 2 of the 5 crew members. This prompted Boeing to come up with an ingeniously simple approach: they created a pilot’s checklist. It is worth noting that using a checklist for takeoff was about as odd as using a checklist to back out of your garage.\nHowever, flying this new plane was too complicated to be left to the memory of any person, no matter how expert. The test pilots made checklists for takeoff, flight, landing, and taxiing, and armed with the checklist, flew a total of 1.8 million miles without one accident. The army ultimately ordered almost 13,000 planes.\nLike flying, many areas of our lives and work have become “too much airplane for one person to fly.”\nFaulty memory and distraction are a constant danger in “all-or-none processes” like going to the shop to buy ingredients for a cake, piloting a plane through a takeoff, or treating a sick person in the hospital. “If you miss just one key thing, you might as well not have made the effort at all,” says Gawande.\nAnother human danger you may well recognize, is allowing yourself to skip steps even when you remember them. You skip steps because it has never been a problem before – until one day it is.\nChecklists can provide protection against such lapses, as they remind us of the minimum necessary steps.\nProfessors Zimmerman and Glouberman distinguish between 3 different kinds of problems: the simple, the complicated, and the complex.\n‘Simple problems’ are ones like baking a cake from a recipe with a few basic techniques you need to learn. Master them and you most likely will have success.\n‘Complicated problems’ are like sending a rocket to the moon. There is no straightforward recipe, and success usually requires many people and great expertise. Unanticipated problems are common, and timing and coordination become serious concerns.\n‘Complex problems’ are like raising a child. You can’t repeat and perfect the process as you can with rockets. Every child is unique, and while expertise is valuable, it is not sufficient. The outcome remains highly uncertain.\nThe value of checklists for simple problems is self-evident: that is why we have a shopping list. But much of the most critical work people do, is not simple. Checklists help prevent failure especially when the problems combine everything from the simple to the complex.\nThe real value of checklists is in conditions of true complexity, where the knowledge requirements exceed that of any individual, and unpredictability reigns. Commands and control from the centre will fail. Under these conditions, not only are checklists a help, they are essential for success. In these complex situations where individuals must exercise their own judgement, this judgement will be enhanced by checklist procedures.\n\nBad checklists are vague and imprecise, too long and hard to use. They are written as if the people using them are stupid, and they try to spell out every single step. Good checklists, are precise and begin with the premise that a checklist cannot fly a plane. That is why, faced with catastrophe, pilots are astonishingly willing to turn to their checklists.\nChecklists come in two forms: DO-CONFIRM and READ-DO. Using a DO-CONFIRM checklist, people do jobs from memory and experience, then stop and check. Using a READ-DO checklist, people carry out the tasks as they check them off, like a recipe.\nTo get value from checklists, they must make sense for the particular situation. A rule-of-thumb is to keep it to between five and nine items, simply worded, and exact.\nDoes this work? This was rigorously tested in the World Health Organization’s ‘safe surgery’ research across a variety of hospitals of different sizes, rich and poor, in countries from Tanzania to the US. In this carefully constructed study, a 2-minute, 19 step surgery checklist, resulted in an immediate drop in infection and mortality in thousands of operations in 8 participating hospitals. Major complications dropped 36%, and deaths fell by 47%.\nThat is how much a checklist can add to the skills of highly trained, highly skilled surgeons. It is worth a serious try in your business. You will get startling results too.\nReadability Light ---+- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy, and is the author of the recently released Executive",

But a simple concept - the checklist - always seems to be an afterthought, or just a general idea (things to do today, etc).

The use of a good checklist can help with ANY endeavor: fundraising, volunteer projects, customer service, problem solving - the list (no pun intended) goes on.

        "comment": "Atul Gawande is a physician interested in improving surgical practice. He reviews surgical cases with disastrous outcomes that could have been prevented and cites research claiming that nearly half of deaths that occur in surgery are in fact preventable. We read a detailed analysis of a drowning accident in which the young victim's life was saved against all odds. Why? Because the hospital staff had discussed and practiced the procedures to treat cold-water drowning ahead of time. They used no new knowledge; they just coordinated and communicated more effectively.\n\nGawande examines how human beings do things. There are two reasons we fail at complex tasks. The first is ignorance. We correct it by conducting research and building schools to increase our knowledge. The second and more common reason for failure is ineptitude--the right knowledge is available, but we do not apply it correctly. People continually forget, are distracted, or skip steps because they seem unimportant. This problem lurks below the radar; we don't recognize it, let alone try to solve it. Instead we send people off for more training to increase their knowledge.\n\nWhat is needed instead is a simple way to remind people of what they know at the right time to make a difference. We have an answer, we just aren't using it. \"Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification, but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.\"\n\nThe author examines checklists used by airline pilots, building contractors, investors and other physicians. In these professions work has become too complex for even a talented individual to perform alone. Teams of skilled experts must manage both communication and complexity to succeed. They do both with checklists. These checklists make people stop and think at \"pause points\" to ensure that the right things have been done. They get coworkers to bond as a team by requiring them to talk to each other. As a result, people become comfortable enough to speak up when they see a potential problem.\n\nChapter Six, The Checklist Factory is the instructional meat of the book, with recommendations that help us develop good checklists. There are direct guidelines about brevity and clarity. There are also process guidelines about identifying common mistakes and fine-tuning a checklist with field testing. He distinguishes between READ-DO checklists, which march novices through the tightly specified steps of rote tasks, and DO-CONFIRM checklists, which provide checkpoints for experienced professionals solving complex problems in coordinated groups. Both have their place, but DO-CONFIRM checklists have the most potential to make a difference.\n\nThere are barriers to checklist use. They have a serious user acceptance problem. Many accomplished professionals consider themselves virtuosos who don't need help from other people at all, let alone somebody else's checklist. To many others checklists seem too mundane to make a difference. The author works hard to persuade us. His own research on checklists in operating rooms finds significant drops in death rates, post-operative infections, and other outcome measures. He highlights successes at prominent hospitals to encourage wider acceptance, asks administrators to impose requirements, and calls on nurses to help change the culture of the operating room. The idea is slowly catching on.\n\nGawande wishes we would move more quickly. \"In the money business everyone looks for an edge. If someone is doing well, people pounce like starved hyenas to find out how. Almost every idea for making even slightly more money ... gets sucked up by the giant maw almost instantly. Every idea, that is except one: checklists.\"\n\nI learned some things from this book and highly recommend it. Give it at least a quick look, starting with Chapter 6. It has the potential to make you even better at what you do best.",

        "comment": "Even though I am not in one hundred percent agreement with some of the terms used to attempt an explanation of human emotion and behavior change this book is still headed in the right direction. As an example, the author uses the term paradigm shift when he experiences a change in perception given a specific circumstance. In my mind, a paradigm shift occurs when there is a permanent change in emotion and behavior which does not occur with most people in a single change of perception. Children can experience a paradigm shift if caught early in a behavior that does not work. A 40 or 50-year-old adult, however, is a very different animal.\n\n“The Way We See the Problem is the Problem.” I agree with this one hundred percent but being told how to reframe it and take another approach without revealing the mechanism of the thought process behind it will only work with some people. Something I have found to be consistent with all people is teaching them the mechanism of how thought emotion and behavior work as opposed to trying to tell them what to do which I think would integrate perfectly with the principals of 7 Habits. An example of one of those mechanisms is our internal dialogue which runs at approximately one thousand to twelve hundred words per minute which is about four times faster then we can speak. This internal dialogue is generated in large part by our self-questioning Following is the mechanism.\n\nExample\nQuestion: Do we ask ourselves questions?\nAnswer: Yes\n\nQuestion: Does the subconscious work on those questions when we are not consciously involved.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nExample: If you see someone you know or an actor you are familiar with and ask yourself “What is their name?” You may not get an answer right away, but in an hour or two or maybe even the next day their name will pop into your head as clear as day.\n\nInternal dialogue is the first and most important thing we can use to change any circumstance. Getting back to “The Way We See the Problem is the Problem.” the first two questions need to be “What can I learn from this” and “How can I use this to move more quickly toward my objectives?”\n\nNow that you understand that you ask questions and the subconscious will work on those questions when you are not consciously involved “How important is the structure of the questions you ask yourself? ” The structure is extremely important because if you ask yourself “Why can't I resolve this issue” what do you think the results will be? The result will be negative because the question is in a negative context.\n\nThe 7 habits make perfect sense but for most consistent implementation will be an issue. There are many moving parts when initiating change or causing a paradigm shift especially if a programmed pattern is 10, 20 or 30 years old. Internal dialogue especially in the form questions, however, is the absolute foundation for initiating and maintaining this shift. Following are some of the questions I use for each of the 7 Habits.\n\nHabit 1: Be Proactive\nWhat action can I take every day to move as quickly as possible toward my objective?\n\nHabit 2: Begin with the End in Mind\nEverything we do in life produces a result, so the key question for Habit 2 is…\nWhat result do I want to produce?”\n\nHabit 3: Put First Things First\nWithin the FEF™ process, there are two keywords which determine one's objectives and define what needs to be put first, and they are “Absolute Must,” so the key question for Habit 3 is…\nWhat are my Absolute Musts or what are my Absolute Musts for today?\n\nHabit 4: Think Win/Win\nThe Win/Win scenario can be accomplished if one has the ability to use every life experience good or bad. This can be done with the two key questions I mentioned earlier.\nWhat can I learn from this? and\nHow can I use this to move more quickly toward my objectives?\n\nHabit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood\nHow can I make sure I have a comprehensive understanding of the people I serve and the objectives I believe will serve them?\nHow can I make sure I am communicating my services in the best way possible?\n\nHabit 6: Synergize\nIn the days of social media, there are many questions regarding Habit 6.\nWill social media create the synergistic relationships I need to achieve my objectives?\nWhat do I need to do to create the synergistic personal relationships that will move me quickly toward my objectives?\n\nHabit 7: Sharpen the Saw\nIn this chapter, Covey reiterates the importance of physical-spiritual mental and social/emotional. I agree on the context but not the order and everything that is included. How we feel about everything in our lives will determine whether we move toward them or not so for me emotion is the most important and this encompasses the mind or what Covey refers to as mental. When establishing objectives in Functional Emotional Fitness™, there are four categories which cover all human objectives and they are “Love, Health, Wealth and Self-Image” which I feel clearly defines the full spectrum of what one needs to keep sharp. You can, however, use Coeys or your own within the context of the following question.\n\nHow can I make sure my Love, Health, Wealth and Self-Image are clearly defined and operating in the 90 plus percent range?\n\nIf you need to generate more questions to make sure you are keeping the saw as sharp as possible simply ask yourself “What questions do I need to ask myself .about Habit 1 or 2 or 3 or 7?”\n\nGiven the current science on the influence of the gut over our thought processes keeping the saw sharp might need to be addressed first. Whatever the case the 7 Habits is a rock solid foundation.",

        "comment": "This book has been on my Currently Reading list for quite some time: I received it as part of my onboarding packet when I started working at Epic Systems seven years ago! In those seven years, I quit Epic, spent time as a freelance designer, guided my kids through Covid virtual learning, and ended up back at my alma mater as a research lab manager. At the same time, I started the book over, reread several parts because I lost my place, and now have finally finished it. Honestly, I think this was exactly the way I needed to read this book. It gave me time to absorb the content, apply the habits one at a time, and experience personal growth before continuing to the next stage. This is not a book with a handful of things you can check off your to do list every day and consider yourself \"successful\", it is at its heart a book of philosophy. As with most philosophy, what you get out of it depends on what you put into it.\n\nThere is a core message evident throughout the book that I found very moving, and kept me coming back to it over the years: Humans are strongest when we work together. To work together we must love each other. To love each other we must listen. To be able to listen with open hearts, we must first learn to love and trust ourselves.\n\nNote that the title is \"The 7 Habits of Highly EFFECTIVE People\". Not \"successful\" or even \"influential\". Because effectiveness depends not on how you appear to other people, but how well you accomplish your personal goals. To be effective, you must have a thorough understanding of what your goals ARE, and what tools you personally have at your disposal to reach them.\n\nLong and short of it: it's a great book. I apply things I have learned from it to every aspect of my life, as a mother, wife, professional, and friend.\n\nSo...what is my reservation? Why four stars instead of five? Covey, possibly inadvertently, strikes a pretty sore spot for me, that I think I may share with a lot of people who grew up in the Evangelical Christian Church. He frequently references \"correct principles\" and at times displays rigid attitudes toward s*xuality and \"vulgarity\" (whatever that means). These are what we might now call \"dog whistle\" terms--they are strongly associated with a movement that has grown more radical and politicized over the last two decades. Covey is a Christian, of course, and openly states that he believes \"correct principles\" and in fact the whole idea of conscience originate from God. I don't think Covey is a radical--he references other religions in addition to Christianity, and his whole approach would seem to indicate a general disapproval of politics--but these \"dog whistles\" still made me uncomfortable. The idea of \"correct principles\", in particular, seems patriarchal, or at the very least implies a rigidity of thought. What he really means by it would seem to be, in much softer terms, \"the laws of natural consequences\" or perhaps, \"Go with what works.\"",

        "comment": "First, let me start off by saying that I've read a lot of different books on personal finance. So I'm very familiar with Dave Ramsey's method of personal finances and a bunch of others. I've read tons of articles, blog posts, etc... on paying off debt and investing, etc...\n\nSo this topic isn't new to me.\n\nSo when I got this book (I got an advanced copy of it)I was figuring that I would read this book and probably wouldn't learn anything new.\n\nI was thinking \"ohhhkaaay...so it's gonna probably talk about how to get out of debt by reducing your spending to almost nothing, eat beans, rice and ramen noodles...cut coupons..and do this for several years then you'll be able to start living your life\"\n\nI figured it would be the same old information that I've read in all the other personal finance books....yaaawn!\n\nBoy oh boy...was I ever wrong\n\nI honestly have to say, that this book was the complete opposite of everything I've ever read.\n\nFor you parents, it's like having two kids.\n\nYou know..your first child is usually calm, relaxed, quiet, well mannered and well behaved.\nThen you have child #2...expecting things to be pretty much the same...only to find out your second child is the complete opposite\nChild #2 is a wild child. Crazy, loud, eats dirt...touches the bathroom handles in public washrooms and then the next minute has their fingers in their mouth\n\nWell, Ramit's book is like your second child.\nLMAO.\n\nIt's fun and actually really interesting to read! ( I know...I know..who says that about a dry topic like paying off debt, investing and saving?).\nIt'll make you laugh in some parts(fo real!).\nAnd...it gets you motivated and makes you want to start taking action as soon as you've finished the chapter\nHe gives you action steps at the end of each chapter that you can start implementing right away!\n\nAnd...it's real! He keeps it sooo real that he even talks about his discussion with his wife when bringing up the topic of having a PRENUP!! (ohhhh snaaaapp!! ...bring out the popcorn cuz it's about to go down!!)\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nOk...so here's what I really liked about this book and thought was friggin awesome!\n\n[1. Conscious Spending]\n\nOk...so we've all heard about \"having a budget\". And when we hear that..we automatically think \"cut back on everything. Use water instead of milk in your cereal. Grow your own coffee beans at home in your backyard and make your own coffee to save a couple of dollars a day\"...right?\n\nBut Ramit goes about this in a TOTALLY different way. And I love his approach to it. It's such a small shift in your mindset, but it has a HUGE impact!!\n\nSo basically, he's telling you this. Instead of thinking of your budget as a way to cut back and not enjoy life..think of it like a plan.\nIt's your plan where you are CONSCIOUSLY choosing how to SPEND your money each month.\n\nBut not only that... this is YOUR life! And to live a \"rich\" and \"happy\" life - you get to choose to spend on the things that make you happy.\nSo why not cut back on the things you hate - so that you can spend on the things you love!\n\nAs he says in Chapter 4 on Conscious Spending \"conscious spending isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. It is, quite simply, about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on—and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.\"\n(BOOOM!! MIC DROP!!)\n\n[2. Scripts to use to save you money]\n\nYou ever get nervous when calling up a financial company (like your credit cards) and then you don't know what to say.\nMaybe you don't know how to negotiate, or you just get nervous and forget what to say.\n\nWell...not to worry.\nRamit gives you WORD FOR WORD scripts that you can use to waive annual fees on your credit cards, and even get fees waived on your bank accounts!\n\nI know...when I read that I was like \"hoollld up..wutcha talkin bout Willis!\"\n\nI told you that this book was the complete opposite of other personal finance books. What other personal finance book is giving you exact scripts to use on how to call up your credit card and get annual fees waived?!\n\nIt's these small details that the average person wants to know cuz let's be real...who likes paying fees? Right?!\n\n[3. Open and Honest]\n\nWhat I really liked...which I've never seen before....was the willingness to be open and direct with the reader.\nRamit laid all the cards on the table and he mentions\na. the exact credit cards he uses\nb. the exact bank accounts he uses\nc. the exact online brokerage account he uses\nd. the investments he puts his money in\n\nWho else does that?\n\nBut not only that....like I said, he GOES THERE and talks about the very very very touchy and sensitive topic of having a prenup.\nIn Chapter 9 LOVE & MONEY - he talks about how he had this difficult conversation with his wife. He also talks about why he decided to do it and should you sign one or not?\n\nAlso in this chapter, he covers difficult topics around money like\na. How to help parents who are in debt\nb. Should you tell your parents and friends how much money you have\nc. Talking Money with your significant other\nd. How to handle money when your spouse makes more than you\ne. How to handle planning for a wedding\nf. Negotiating your salary at work\nand more and more...\n\nI'm telling you...Chapter 9 is where it all goes down!\nJust keepin it real with ya...this is the stuff that we REALLY want to know about. This is the real life stuff we deal with on a day to day basis that NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT!!\n\nI mean, sure...we want to know how to pay off debt, invest, etc... But let's be real. That part is boring.\n\nThat's like reading the first few chapters of a hot & steamy novel..like 50 shades of gray. It's necessary to build the story, but the REAL juicy stuff happens later on.... and that's the part you want to get to.\n\nWe've all had a difficult convo with someone about money (spouse, fiance, boyfriend/girlfriend, etc..)\nDon't you wish you knew how to handle it better...well now you will! Now you'll have a plan\n\n[4. He's very specific]\n\nFor example, in Chapter 7 he talks about investing. And he recommends setting up your asset allocation using David Swensen's recommendation. Swensen manages Yale's endowment for more than 30 years and has an amazing 13.5% annualized return.\nHe even gives you the exact percentage's to use\n\n30 percent—Domestic equities\n15 percent—Developed-world international equities\n5 percent—Emerging-market equities\n20 percent—Real estate investment trusts\n15 percent—Government bonds\n15 percent—Treasury inflation-protected securities\n\nI like this because it takes the guess work out of it for you\nJust do exactly what he's laid out - and boom! You've got a successful investing plan in place.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nWHAT'S DIFFERENT\n\nHere are some things that I found different with this book vs other personal finance books\n\n[1. Focus on Big wins, not small wins]\nSo for example, instead of chasing small percentages by getting introductory rates for high interest savings accounts, focus on your asset allocation and what you're invested in. Your time is much better spent focusing on that, and it will have much bigger returns in the long run\nRamit continues to remind us that it is better to use your time working on things that will have a big impact on your life (i.e. setting up your automated investing) vs spending hours or days looking for the perfect credit card.\n\n[2. Word for Word Scripts]\nAs I mentioned, he gives you exact scripts you can use to save money and get fees waived\n\n[3. Automating your finances]\nLet's be real..who REALLY enjoys paying bills? Who really enjoys reading over investment statements and managing their money? No one!..that's who! Not even Ramit (he even admits this in the book)\n\nPlus - we're all lazy. We don't really want to set aside time to look at our investments. We say we will...but let's be honest..most of us don't.\n\nSo in Chapter 5 - he shows you how to automate your finances so that you can get on with your life. He shows you how to setup a system so that your bills get paid automatically and your investment accounts get funded automatically.\n\nAnd when it's all setup and done...you basically only have to spend 1hr a month looking over your finances, so that you can get on with the more important things in your life\n\n[4. Conversations around money]\n\nHe talks about things that others don't talk about...like the judgement you get from friends and family when you spend money on certain things you like...or how we may judge others on things they spend..but we don't know the full context.\n\nOr I'm sure we've all had that one friend who says to you \"why do you still have that old iphone? Don't you think it's time to upgrade?\"\n\nThis was very eye-opening to me and it was great to see someone finally be honest and talk about these things. I have never read a personal finance book that talks about these real life situations this way before\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWHAT IS MISSING\n\nHere are some things I found that were missing from the book\n\n[1. Real Estate Investments]\n\nI'm actually kind of surprised that he didn't talk about investing in real estate (residential or commercial)\nThis is such a hot topic, and there are TONS of Real estate related TV shows now about flipping homes, or agents finding these multi-million dollar homes for their clients.\n\nI think it's a topic that many people are also interested in.\n\nAlso, just based on regular \"street knowledge\"...the average person probably has an easier time understanding real estate and owning property vs understanding how the stock market and index funds work.\n\nThey probably feel more comfortable with real estate because it's a physical asset, whereas the stock market may feel like black magic to a lot of people.\n\nHe talks about Cryptocurrency, so I thought for sure he'd talk about investing in real estate.\nBut he didn't\n\nI wish he had touched on Real Estate as an investment and mention at least what percentage of your portfolio should be allocated towards real estate and how to go about investing in it in a strategic, methodical manner. Kind of like how he explained how to invest in the stock market\n\n[2. Saving up and paying cash for your car]\n\nI found it odd that he didn't talk about the option of saving up and paying for a car in cash.\nHe does talk about how to buy a car, but it involves getting a loan.\nWhich - I found ironic because Ramit is completely against debt.\nSo it didn't make sense to me why he is telling us to get a loan for a car\n\nHe mentions how to save up for other big ticket items (like your wedding, etc..) but he doesn't give you a plan on how to save up for your car and use cash so that you can avoid getting into debt and getting a car loan.\n\nI'm not sure what the reason is behind this...but this was very surprising to me.\n\n[3. Investing in blue-chip stable companies]\n\nRamit is against picking and investing in individual stocks. He recommends investing in Index Funds instead. And for the average person, I understand why\nAnd..he explains why in the book (Chapter 7)\n\nBut - at the same time, I think there could have been an opportunity to mention in the book how to invest in well known, stable, big name companies that have been around for many decades that produce dividends and can be a good addition to your portfolio\n\nI'm not saying that they should make up the majority of your portfolio, but perhaps a small percentage.\n\nRamit is very methodical - and I believe he could have given some sound advice on some criteria to look at for blue-chip companies that have been around forever, and would be solid investments.\n\nOne company that comes to mind that Warren Buffett publicly admits he likes is Coca-Cola. It's not an exciting company but it has a history of being stable and producing dividends for the investor.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nMAIN TAKEAWAY FROM THE BOOK\n\nThe main theme of this book is all about living your Rich Life\nAnd of course, living a Rich Life will mean different things for different people.\nFor one person, that might mean always upgrading their seats on a flight to the seats with extra leg room...for another, that might mean always buying the VIP section tickets at concerts but also that person could care less about eating out at lunch so they always pack their lunch.\n\nIn Chapter 9 (A Rich Life) ...Ramit says :\n\n\"it’s about not having to think about money all the time and being able to travel and work on the things that interest me.\"\n\nthis pretty much sums it all up right here.\n\nI realized that life is more about enjoying your money, and using it to do the things that bring you joy and make you happy. Whatever those things are for you. You will have to decide.\n\nI already had a mindset of doing the things I enjoy...but this book helped me to get more clarity on exactly how to do that on a daily basis.\n\nThis book helped me to have a plan to set aside a specific amount each month towards things I love. And more importantly, how to NOT feel GUILTY about spending on things I enjoy (like upgrading my seats on flights or buying courtside basketball seats) because I am cutting back on things I don't like as much (like paying a cable bill)\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWHO SHOULD GET THIS BOOK\n\nThis book is for the person who\n1. hates manually paying their bills each month\n2. wants to have simple and easy investments that they actually understand\n3. wants to not feel guilty about spending on things they love\n4. wants an easy to understand plan on how to pay off debts and still enjoy life (without eating ramen noodles and cutting coupons)\n5. wants tips for having real life awkward conversations with friends and family about money\n6. wants to enjoy their money and know that in the background their money is growing and they will have enough to retire\n7. is tired of the regular boring personal advice that they've read for years and years\n\nRamit's approach is like that one friend who tells you how it is. They call you out on your B.S. and you appreciate them for it cuz they always keep it real with you and you know that they want nothing but the best for ya.\n\nIf you like that quality in people, then you will most definitely enjoy this book!\n\nalso...just being honest...I would've given it 4.5 stars, but there was no way to do so. I think 5 stars is for absolute perfection\nAnd since Ramit left out the topic of Real Estate Investing, he didn't discuss the option of saving up and paying cash for a car and I think he could've touched on investing in blue chip stable companies - I would say it's 4.5 stars (in my opinion)\n\nIt's still an awesome book and by far the best most COMPLETE book I've read on personal finances because it handles those real life topics around money that happen to all of us, but no one else is talking about.",

Combined with Ramit’s podcast this changed the way I think about money and helped me understand why I spend and save the way I do. It also helped me start a no fuss money management system that runs itself. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to improve their personal finances.",

It doesn’t mention the retired people’s dilemma of Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) withdrawals from IRA accounts starting at age 70 1/2 and above, hurting them through higher taxes on income and Social Security.\nThis is a great book and one of the best book on controlling your finances and on investments. Some of the topics are repeated such as about car and home purchase which can be skipped. Otherwise a great read and his perspective with myself coming from the same ancestry as his parents.",

        "comment": "I will teach to you to be rich…. The A-Z guide for those of us who don’t have a clue of where to start! Chances are, if you’re reading this, you’re a lot like me.\n\nIntrigue by the notion of being “rich,” but pretty sure it’s a quick rich scheme of some sort. Like that old friend from high school who suddenly friends you on Facebook, then one day tricks you into going out for a coffee date to catch up on life… only to pop open a laptop and try to set you up to be a consultant for a natural beauty company that is not \"a pyramid scheme.” Yeah, I hate those too.\n\nBut here’s what I do know from stalking *ahem* following Ramit, and soaking up all the goodness through his emails: THIS guy knows his stuff. No fluff.\n\nHe provides you actionable steps and tells you EXACTLY what to do. He’s done the research, and with each chapter, I simply did exactly what he tells me to do.\n\nHe drops names, and tells you which banks to get away from— and which ones he personally uses and trusts. That’s the thing about Ramit, he’s of the straight and narrow, and tells you how he sees it. All his recommendations are based off his own personal experience, and when you haven’t a clue of where to start— like there’s such a thing as a high-interest savings account (whaaa?!), and there’s an alternative for those of us who don’t have a 401K with employer match?!\n\nYes, he goes over the “technical” aspects of money… providing you a step-by-step framework on how to get your finances in order, and how to automate it so you don’t have to keep thinking about it or neglecting it (which you may be doing right now, if you’re still reading this review).\n\nHe simplifies it, breaks it down for you Ramit-style, so just follow the system. This 6-week program, which yes, you can probably take it slower if you like, works. Just DON’T deviate from the system.\n\nI’ll challenge you to stick with it. Give yourself a deadline, and stick with the deadline.\n\nWhy? Because if you don’t set deadlines for yourself, you’re going to procrastinate… and the next thing you know, it’s been a whole year, and you haven’t read past the first chapter.\n\nSo, just trust me on this okay? The moment you get to the section on compound interest, you’ll have your Oprah Winfrey aha moment complete with the brand new car (close enough) that has you sending me virtual high fives for telling you to JUST START today!\n\nBut seriously, if you don’t give yourself a deadline, you’ll never open the accounts he tells you, and then you’ll get frustrated, and instead of trusting the system, you’re going to deviate, get mad, and write a mean reply on my comment calling me a liar, because it didn’t work for you.\n\nOf course, it didn’t work for you! You didn’t do the work.\n\nSo, read the book and do the work.\n\nDo you know why the KonMori method works? It works because those who were serious about getting their house in order had a deadline for removing the clutter from their house. They got serious about getting their home in order in the next 30 days, and keeping only the items that truly \"spark joy.”\n\nAnd that’s how you begin to build momentum, but without a deadline you can easily lose momentum.\n\nSimilarly, Ramit takes you step-by-step, telling you EXACTLY how to set up specific accounts (sorry guys— not going to give the whole book away!), teaches you how to automate, understand your money dials, what you truly value, and how to get you from broke to implementing strategies to help you live a rich life that is in alignment with what you truly value.\n\nThis book challenged me in many ways, forcing me to take a closer look at my finances, I opened up new accounts for the first time, started learning about investments, and having difficult money conversations with my husband (no spoilers here— but Ramit provides you scripts to help you work through these difficult conversations with your partner to getting those overdraft charges removed from your account to negotiating a lower interest rate on your credit cards. You’re welcome.)\n\nWhat does my rich life look like? Going on road trips with my family of five. I’ve designated one sub-savings account for vacations, set up to be automatically funded, and we’re going to take a trip nine months out of the year.\n\nYou may be thinking it’s not possible, or your circumstances doesn’t allow you the time to get through the program. Here’s what I know about you. You’ve read this far. You’re curious. It’s a small investment for your future, your family’s future.\n\nAnd as a mom of three, two with special needs, someone who works part-time for a non-profit, while running an on-line business part-time, I get it.\n\nYou have the time you make. You can do this. I’ve committed to getting our finances in order for myself, and for my family. I know you can do it too.\n\nThe minute your book arrives, write a date on your calendar…. 6 weeks from today, and work through the book. It’s not magic, but it’s a system that works if you’re willing to do the work. You got this!",

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.",

        "comment": "When you come late to the party, writing the 160th review, you have a certain freedom to write something as much for your own use as for other readers, confident that the review will be at the bottom of the pile.\n\nKahneman's thesis is that the human animal is systematically illogical. Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.\n\nThe first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow, applying human logic, we might reflect that it is probably Johnny coming back from the Girl Scout camp across the river bringing cookies, and that running might not be the best idea. However, fast thinking is hardwired.\n\nThe first part of the book is dedicated to a description of the two systems, the fast and slow system. Kahneman introduces them in his first chapter as system one and system two.\n\nChapter 2 talks about the human energy budget. Thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain. Moreover, despite what your teenager tells you, dedicating energy to thinking about one thing means that energy is not available for other things. Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.\n\nChapter 3 expands on this notion of the lazy controller. We don't invoke our slow thinking, system two machinery unless it is needed. It is expensive. As an example, try multiplying two two-digit numbers in your head while you are running. You will inevitably slow down. NB: Kahneman uses the example of multiplying two digit numbers in your head quite frequently. Most readers don't know how to do this. Check out \"The Secrets of Mental Math\" for techniques. Kahneman and myself being slightly older guys, we probably like to do it just to prove we still can. Whistling past the graveyard - we know full well that mental processes slow down after 65.\n\nChapter 4 - the associative machine - discusses the way the brain is wired to automatically associate words with one another and concepts with one another, and a new experience with a recent experience. Think of it as the bananas vomit chapter. Will you think of next time you see a banana?\n\nChapter 5 - cognitive ease. We are lazy. We don't solve the right problem, we solve the easy problem.\n\nChapter 6 - norms, surprises, and causes. A recurrent theme in the book is that although our brains do contain a statistical algorithm, it is not very accurate. It does not understand the normal distribution. We are inclined to expect more regularity than actually exists in the world, and we have poor intuition about the tail ends of the bell curve. We have little intuition at all about non-Gaussian distributions.\n\nChapter 7 - a machine for jumping to conclusions. He introduces a recurrent example. A ball and bat together cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? System one, fast thinking, leaps out with an answer which is wrong. It requires slow thinking to come up with the right answer - and the instinct to distrust your intuition.\n\nChapter 8 - how judgments happen. Drawing parallels across domains. If Tom was as smart as he is tall, how smart would he be?\n\nChapter 9 - answering an easier question. Some questions have no easy answer. \"How do you feel about yourself these days?\" Is harder to answer than \"did you have a date last week?\" If the date question is asked first, it primes an answer for the harder question.\n\nSection 2 - heuristics and biases\n\nChapter 10 - the law of small numbers. In the realm of statistics there is a law of large numbers. The larger the sample size, the more accurate the statistical inference from measuring them. Conversely, a small sample size can be quite biased. I was in a study abroad program with 10 women, three of them over six feet. Could I generalize about the women in the University of Maryland student body? Conversely, I was the only male among 11 students and the only one over 60. Could they generalize anything from that? In both cases, not much.\n\nChapter 11 - anchors. A irrelevant notion is a hard thing to get rid of. For instance, the asking price of the house should have nothing to do with its value, but it does greatly influence bids.\n\nChapter 12 - the science of availability. If examples come easily to mind, we are more inclined to believe the statistic. If I know somebody who got mugged last year, and you don't, my assessment of the rate of street crime will probably be too high, and yours perhaps too low. Newspaper headlines distort all of our thinking about the probabilities of things like in and terrorist attacks. Because we read about it, it is available.\n\nChapter 13 - availability, emotion and risk. Continuation.\n\nChapter 14 - Tom W's specialty. This is about the tendency for stereotypes to override statistics. If half the students in the University area education majors, and only a 10th of a percent study mortuary science, the odds are overwhelming that any individual student is an education major. Nonetheless, if you ask about Tom W, a sallow gloomy type of guy, people will ignore the statistics and guess he is in mortuary science.\n\nChapter 15 - less is more. Linda is described as a very intelligent and assertive woman. What are the odds she is a business major? The odds that she is a feminist business major? Despite the mathematical impossibility, most people will think that the odds of the latter are greater than the former.\n\nChapter 16 - causes trump statistics. The most important aspect of this chapter is Bayesian analysis, which is so much second nature to Kahneman that he doesn't even describe it. The example he gives is a useful illustration.\n* 85% of the cabs in the city are green, and 15% are blue.\n* A witness identified the cab involved in a hit and run as blue.\n* The court tested the witness' reliability, and the witness was able to correctly identify the correct color 80% of the time, and failed 20% of the time.\nFirst, to go to the point. Given these numbers, most people will assume that the cab in the accident was blue because of the witness testimony. However, if we change the statement of the problem so that there is a 20% chance that the blue identification of the color was wrong, but 85% of the cabs involved in accidents are green, people will overwhelmingly say that the cab in the accident was a green madman. The problems are mathematically identical but the opinion is different.\nNow the surprise. The correct answer is that there is a 41% chance that the cab involved in the accident was blue. Here's how we figure it out from Bayes theorem.\nIf the cab was blue, a 15% chance, and correctly identified, an 80% chance, the combined probability is .15 * .8 = .12, a 12% chance\nIf the cab was green, an 85% chance, and incorrectly identified, a 20% chance, the combined probability is .85 * .2 = .17, a 17% chance\nSince the cab had to be either blue or green, the total probability of it being identified as blue, whether right or wrong, is .12 + .17 = .29. In other words, this witness could be expected to identify the cab as blue 29% of the time whether she was right or wrong.\nThe chances she was right are .12 out of .29, or 41%. Recommend that you cut and paste this, because Bayes theorem is cited fairly often, and is kind of hard to understand. It may be simple for Kahneman, but it is not for his average reader, I am sure.\n\nChapter 17 - regression to the mean. If I told you I got an SAT score of 750 you could assume that I was smart, or that I was lucky, or some combination. The average is only around 500. The chances are little bit of both, and if I take a test a second time I will get a lower score, not because I am any stupider but because your first observation of me wasn't exactly accurate. This is called regression to the mean. It is not about the things you are measuring, it is about the nature of measurement instruments. Don't mistake luck for talent.\n\nChapter 18 - taming intuitive predictions. The probability of the occurrence of an event which depends on a number of prior events is the cumulative probability of all those prior events. The probability of a smart grade school kid becoming a Rhodes scholar is a cumulative probability of passing a whole series of hurdles: studying hard, excelling in high school, avoiding drink and drugs, parental support and so on. The message in this chapter is that we tend to overestimate our ability to project the future.\n\nPart three - overconfidence\n\nChapter 19 - the illusion of understanding. Kahneman introduces another potent concept, \"what you see is all there is,\" thereinafter WYSIATI. We make judgments on the basis of the knowledge we have, and we are overconfident about the predictive value of that observation. To repeat their example, we see the tremendous success of Google. We discount the many perils which could have totally derailed the company along the way, including the venture capitalist who could have bought it all for one million dollars but thought the price was too steep.\n\nChapter 20 - The illusion of validity. Kahneman once again anticipates a bit more statistical knowledge than his readers are likely to have. The validity of a measure is the degree to which an instrument measures what it purports to measure. You could ask a question such as whether the SAT is a valid measure of intelligence. The answer is, not really, because performance on the SAT depends quite a bit on prior education and previous exposure to standardized tests. You could ask whether the SAT is a valid predictor of performance in college. The answer there is that it is not very good, but nonetheless it is the best available predictor. It is valid enough because there is nothing better. To get back to the point, we are inclined to assume measurements are more valid than they are, in other words, to overestimate our ability to predict based on measurements.\n\nChapter 21 - intuitions versus formulas. The key anecdote here is about a formula for predicting the quality of a French wine vintage. The rule of thumb formula beat the best French wine experts. Likewise, mathematical algorithms for predicting college success are as least as successful, and much cheaper, than long interviews with placement specialists.\n\nChapter 22 - expert intuition, when can we trust it? The short answer to this is, in situations in which prior experience is quite germane to new situations and there is some degree of predictability, and also an environment which provides feedback so that the experts can validate their predictions. He would trust the expert intuition of a firefighter; there is some similarity among fires, and the firemen learns quickly about his mistakes. He would not trust the intuition of a psychiatrist, whose mistakes may not show up for years.\n\nChapter 23 - the outside view. The key notion here is that people within an institution, project, or any endeavor tend to let their inside knowledge blind them to things an outsider might see. We can be sure that most insiders in Enron foresaw nothing but success. An outsider, having seen more cases of off-balance-sheet accounting and the woes it can cause, would have had a different prediction.\n\nChapter 24 - the engine of capitalism. This is a tour of decision-making within the capitalist citadel. It should destroy the notion that there are CEOs who are vastly above average, and also the efficient markets theory. Nope. The guys in charge often don't understand, and more important, they are blind to their own lack of knowledge.\n\nPart four - choices\n\nThis is a series of chapters about how people make decisions involving money and risk. In most of the examples presented there is a financially optimal alternative. Many people will not find that alternative because of the way the problem is cast and because of the exogenous factors. Those factors include:\n\nMarginal utility. Another thousand dollars is much less important to a millionaire than a wage slave.\n\nChapter 26 - Prospect theory: The bias against loss. Losing $1000 causes pain out of proportion to the pleasure of winning $1000.\n\nChapter 27 - The endowment effect. I will not pay as much to acquire something as I would demand if I already owned it and were selling.\n\nChapter 28 - Bad Events. We will take unreasonable risk when all the alternatives are bad. Pouring good money after bad, the sunk cost effect, is an example.\n\nChapter 29 - The fourfold pattern. High risk, low risk, win, lose. Human nature is to make choices which are not mathematically optimal: buying lottery tickets and buying unnecessary insurance.\n\nChapter 30 - rare events. Our minds are not structured to assess the likelihood of rare events. We overestimate the visible ones, such as tsunamis and terrorist attacks, and ignore the ones of which we are unaware.\n\nChapter 31 - Risk policies. This is about systematizing our acceptance of risk and making policies. As a policy, should we buy insurance or not, recognizing that there are instances in which we may override the policy. As a policy, should we accept the supposedly lower risk of buying mutual funds, even given the management fees?\n\nChapter 32 - keeping score. This is about letting the past influence present decisions. The classic example is people who refuse to sell for a loss, whether shares of stock or a house.\n\nChapter 33 - reversals. We can let a little negative impact a large positive. One cockroach in a crate of strawberries.\n\nChapter 34 - Frames and reality. How we state it. 90% survival is more attractive than 10% mortality.\n\nPart V. Two selves: Experience and memory\n\nOur memory may be at odds with our experience at the time. Mountain climbing or marathon running are sheer torture at the time, but the memories are exquisite. We remember episodes such as childbirth by the extreme of pain, not the duration.\n\nLift decision: do we live life for the present experience, or the anticipated memories? Are we hedonists, or Japanese/German tourists photographing everything to better enjoy the memories?",

        "comment": "This is an invaluable book that every person who considers him/herself educated should read - even study. Indeed, it is a scandal that mastering the material in this book isn't considered an essential component of a high school education.\n\nThe author was awarded the Nobel in Economics for his work on what he calls decision theory, or the study of the actual workings of the typical human mind in the evaluation of choices, and the book itself presents the findings of many decades of psychological studies that expose the endemic fallacious thinking that we are all prone to, more or less. The lives of all of us could be improved by lessons learned from this book, not just individually, through self-education, but also on the large scale, if the large scale decision makers in this society in and out of government could be educated as well. In fact, it is largely because these large scale decision makers are no better than the rest of us in their ability to think straight and plan well, that society is as screwed up as it is, and that essentially all of its institutions are diseased and corrupt. The lesson there, however, is that decision making needs to be returned to the individual - that the powers that be need to be deprived of their powers to mess up the lives of the rest of us.\n\nDespite the many virtues of this book - it is well-written, engaging, and its academic author reasonably restrained in the tendencies of his tribe to blathering in abstractions - it is a bit disappointing at the very end, when the author proves unable to synthesize all his material into a comprehensive theory of the thinking, and deciding mind - or at least into a set of carefully formulated principles that provide a succinct summary of the principles of human thinking, both typical and ideal.\n\nKahneman uses throughout a construct that implies that we are of two minds: System 1 is the fast-thinking, intuitive, mind, prone to jumping to conclusions; while System 2 is the slow-thinking analytical mind, that is brought into play, if at all, only to critique and validate the conclusions that we have jumped to. System 2, we are told, is lazy, and if often just rubber-stamps the snap judgements of System 1, or if pressed, rationalize them, instead of digging critically as well as constructively into the complex underpinnings of the material and sorting them out as best it can.\n\nInstead of working this construct up into a comprehensive model of mind, K merely uses it as a loose schema for representing the kinds of thinking thought to underlie the results derived from the many psychological experiments that he here reports on. This neglect raises the question at many points as to just how well the experimenters have really understood the thinking that underlies the behavior of their subjects. But this, I am sorry to say, is a weakness of virtually all psychological experimentation, which is still just beginning to come to grips with the complexity and varieties of cognitive style of the human mind.\n\nWhat Kahneman does do, however, is to provide convenient labels for many characteristic types of fallacious thinking, although again, the exact role of System 1 and System 2, and their interaction, is inadequately explicated. Instead, towards the end of the book, another, somehow related, but nominally independent theme is developed: the disturbing divergence between the experiencing self and the remembering self. This is in itself such an interesting and important idea, so pregnant with both psychological and philosophical implications, that it could have used a fuller treatment, and again, there is no coherent integration of this theme with the System1/System2 construct.\n\nThe idea here is that our present experience includes our most salient memories of previous experiences - for example the highlights of past vacations, or out of the ordinary episodes of our lives. Somewhat surprisingly, though, what we remember is a systematic distortion of the actual experience. Our memory collapse the duration of various aspects of our experience and highlights only the peak moment(s) and the final moments, perhaps with a nod toward the initial presentation of the experience. And this systematic distortion of the actual experience in all its fullness, can lead us to make irrational and detrimental choices in deciding whether to repeat the experience in the future. Thus, a bad ending to an otherwise wonderful experience can spoil the whole thing for us in memory, and cause us to avoid similar experiences in the future, even though by simply anticipating and improving the ending we might make the whole experience as wonderful as most of the original was. Likewise, subjects in experiments involving either long durations of pain, or much shorter episodes of pain with a higher peak, were consistently more averse to the latter rather than the former - or they overemphasized the way these presentations ended as a factor in judging them as a whole.\n\nThese are important findings that go the heart of the question of how best to steer our course through life, but here is the only attempt at integration of this remembering vs experiencing self theme, and the System 1/ System 2 theme that I find in the final chapter, Conclusions:\n\n\"The remembering self is a construction of System 2. However, the distinctive features of the way it evaluates episodes and lives are characteristics of our memory. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule originate in System 1 and do not necessarily conform to the values of System 2\".\n\nThere is more here, but it merely repeats the earlier analysis of the relevant experiments.\n\nNo evidence is presented as to the respective roles of System 1 and System 2 with respect to the laying down of memory, to its decay, or with respect to a recently discovered phenomenon: memory reconsolidation. Nor is any account taken of what has been learned, much of it in recent decades, about the interactions between short, intermediate, and long term memory, or any of the radically different modalities of episodic (picture strip) and semantic (organized, abstracted) memory. Consequently, Kahneman's vague reference to the \"characteristics of our memory\" is essentially a ducking of the question of what the remembering self is. I think that at best, the finding of the replacement of the original experience by an abstract predicated on peak-end bias is an exaggeration, though there's no question that \"duration neglect\" is in operation, and a good thing too, unless K means by \"duration neglect\" not just the stretches of minimally changing experience (which have little memorial significance anyway, but even the consciousness of how long the edited out parts were (this distinction was never made in Chapter 35, where the theme of the remembering vs. the experiencing self is first taken up).\n\nSpeaking for myself anyway, I have a much fuller memory of my most important experiences than Kahneman seems to indicate. Naturally the highlights are featured, but what I tend to remember are representative moments that I took conscious note of at the time, as though making a psychological photograph. I remember these moments also because I bring them up from time to time when I'm thinking about that experience. For example, I'm thinking now of a long distance race I did in 2014 (a very tough half-marathon, with almost 2000' of climbing). I remember: the beginning section as well as the ending section; each of the rest stations; certain moments of each of the major hill climbs; at least one moment from each of the descents; and a number of other happenings during the almost three hour event. For me in this race, the peak experience occurred right at the end, when I all but collapsed, yet managed to stagger to the finish line. That ending does naturally come first to mind as a representation of the entire event, but it is merely the culmination of a long and memorable experience with many moving parts, and if I want, my remembering self can still conjure up many other moments, as well as a clear sense of the duration of each of the sections of the course.\n\nOver many years most memories fade, and it's certainly reasonable to suppose that in extreme cases, where they are all but forgotten, only a single representative moment might be retained. However, if we can say anything for sure about memory it is this: we remember what we continue to think of and to use, and we do that precisely because this material has continuing importance to us. The recent research in memory reconsolidation tells us that when we do bring up memories only occasionally, we reinforce them, but we also edit and modify them to reflect our current perspectives, and sometimes we conflate them with other seemingly related knowledge that we've accrued. We are thus prone to distort our own original memories over time, in some cases significantly, but we may still retain much more of the original experience that just the peak and the end, and if we do reinterpret our memories in the light of more recent experience, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In any case, the memories that occur in the present may be said to be a joint project of the experiencing as well as the remembering self, which rather erodes the whole Two Selves concept that Kahneman first posited.\n\nI do not mean to criticize the valuable evidential material in the book, and in general I think that Kahneman, and the other researchers and thinkers whom he quotes, have drawn reasonable conclusions from the experiments they report on. But ultimately, the book, as well as the fields both of psychology and brain neurophysiology suffer both in coherence and meaningfulness because they aren't predicated on a more comprehensive theory of mind. It's the old story in science, first formulated by Karl Popper in his 1935 book, The Logic of Scientific Discovery: unless we approach the data with an hypothesis in mind - unless, indeed, we seek out data likely to be relevant to a particular hypothesis, we're not going to make any enduring progress in understanding that data in a comprehensively meaningful way, let alone be able to make falsifiable deductions about elements of the system for which we have at present no data. Popper's quotation from the German philosopher Novalis comes to mind - \"Theories are nets: only he who casts will catch.\"\n\nIn the final, \"Conclusions\", chapter, K caricatures the abstract economists' model of homo econimicus (man as a rational optimizer of his utility), contrasting it with the more sophisticated and experientially grounded model of psychologists such as himself. In keeping with his penchant for framing (or spinning) his presentation favorably to his own perspective, he calls the economists' model \"Econ\", and his own \"Human\". In fact, \"Econ\" was never meant to represent man in all his humanity, and Kahneman's Economics Nobel, recognizing his decision theory contributions to economics, was preceded by many other Nobels to economists who had been expanding the concept of the economic actor into psychological territory for decades. In fact, the essential view of the Austrian economists dating from the 1920s (von Mises, Hayek, and their predecessors) is that economics is in the end wholly dependent on psychology because it is predicated on the unknowable, unquantifiable subjective value preferences of humans, acting individually and in concert. Cautious generalizations can perhaps be made about human psychology in general, but I think that on the whole the Austrians have been a bit wiser in their restraint than Kahneman and his many, and mostly lesser, pop psychology compatriots have proved in their often sensationalist extrapolations from lab experiments.\n\nHere is an example, I think of Kahneman over-reaching. He speaks repeatedly of the laziness of System 2, and its foot dragging reluctance to get involved in the thinking process, but in the real world, snap judgements are good enough for immediate purposes, and the better part of rationality may be to go with one's fast thinking intuitive System 1: indeed, Kahneman acknowledges this himself in passing, both in his beginning and his ending, but this isn't enough to counterbalance the overall argument of his book.\n\nKahneman also, in his final chapter, speculatively extends his findings into the political sphere (his liberal Democratic Party bias has already been made clear by gratuitous and somewhat annoying usage of salient modern politicians in examples), but not to any great effect.\n\nKahneman advocates \"libertarian paternalism\" consisting of government programs that people are enrolled in automatically unless they opt out by checking a box on forms - thus manipulating the presentation frame so as to trick them into signing on to what some government bureaucrat thinks is good for them. Of course, as long as people are allowed to opt out, one can't call the choice here anything but libertarian, though to be consistent with their socialist mores, liberals like Kahneman really ought to object to such practices as being manipulative advertising. This libertarian finds nothing objectionable about the way such a choice might be presented - after all, the average man, if adequately educated and prepared for the real world, should have no trouble seeing through the frames. What is not only paternalistic, but totalitarian in spirit, is the extortion of taxpayer money to finance such government programs in the first place.\n\nSomehow, it fails to occur to Kahneman that most people could be trained to recognize and avoid fallacious thinking during all those years of enforced and mostly wasteful schooling - just as most people can be trained to recognize the Müller-Lyer illusion for what it is. IMO every high school graduate should be required to learn to recognize and avoid the paradigm cases of fallacious thinking presented in Thinking, Fast, and Slow, and this material could profitably be expanded to cover the many rhetorical tricks used by the manipulators and spinmeisters, both public and private, who batten off of our society. With such training in critical thinking, and with the reintroduction of enough honest and rigor to begin high school graduates up to the 12th grade reading and writing proficiencies that were routine in the 1950s, the need for college as life preparation would be altogether obviated, and most young people could avoid wasting their early years in college, piling up debt, and get on with their work and/or their self-education, as they chose.",

In the book that People magazine proclaimed “beguiling” and “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.   Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package, The 48 Laws of Power is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.",

        "comment": "there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact you\n\nFirst, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas\n1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can \"not participate\" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still. Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples\n2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS. If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this book.\n\nThings I Liked\n- NEW PARADIGM\nafter reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.\n- INCREASES POWER\none of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws\n-CRYSTAL CLEAR\nevery law is clearly outlined with \"transgression\" of the law, \"observance\" of the law, keys to power, and a \"reversal\"\n-GREAT STORIES\nthe 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\n-RISKY\nan old proverb says \" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten\". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships\n- REQUIRES DISCERNMENT\nif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says \"do xyz and you will accomplish vyx\" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply\n-NOT FOR EVERYONE\nIf you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.\n\nOVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.\nThanks for reading",

Do you know who to trust? People imagine retirement as learning new things, challenging themselves, giving back as a mentor, spending their days with family and friends, or filling them with exciting adventures. The vision is the beginning but realizing those goals requires more steps than people realize.  Your Insiders’ Guide to Retirement serves as a mentor for retirees written by three advisors who have helped many down this path countless times with a proven system in place. With a combined seventy-five years of experience in financial services, Troy Daum, R.J. Gordon Tudor, and Jeff Poole explore why people are fed up with the scandals of Wall Street, brokerages, and insurance companies. They introduce readers to an exciting new profession where companies act as a fiduciary. They present a paradigm shift in the financial services space and emphasize the importance of why retirees must understand and have a financial plan, and how they, too, can follow the path to an amazing retirement journey.   “A groundbreaking book.” —Chicago Tribune   “Written with encouraging anecdotes and sound advice, this book serves as a guide to help readers outline the life they want to live during retirement.” —Capital Gazette   “Show[s] why having the right advisor will make all the difference between living with financial worries and having a life of financial independence.” —Peter Mangan, CEO, Shareholders Service Group",

    "synopsis": "Do you ever think you’re the only one making any sense? Or tried to reason with your partner with disastrous results? Do long, rambling answers drive you crazy? Or does your colleague’s abrasive manner rub you the wrong way? You are not alone. After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was ‘surrounded by idiots’, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people. Surrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with – in and out of the office – based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way we speak and share information. Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication, advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or shut up. Packed with ‘aha!’ and ‘oh no!’ moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand and communicate with those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension. And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn’t you!",

        "comment": "To be completely honest, I decided to read this book, titled Surrounded by Idiots - The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and Life), after a particularly difficult day of teaching high school students. I saw the words “Surrounded by Idiots” in the list of options and thought, yup that’s the one. Every teacher can relate to those difficult days sometimes, but the ideas Erikson writes about in this book can be relatable to anyone at any time. He starts off explaining that we, in fact, are not surrounded by idiots. We are simply surrounded by people who are different than us and who think differently than us. Everyone has a tendency to think people who are different than us are idiots, but that is not necessarily the case.\nPerhaps if I was having a better day when I chose to read this book, I would have looked at the rest of the title – “The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and Life).” This is a little more descriptive of the ideas Erikson touches on. The four types of human behavior, as Erikson explains it, is broken down into four different colors. This is just his way of organizing the information, but I find it clever and easy to follow. Erikson says on page 13, that most of the population is a combination of two colors, while few are purely one color or a mixture of three colors. He starts off with just describing personality characteristics of each color and how to recognize if someone in your life is a red, yellow, green, or blue. I very much enjoyed this, because I could pin point exact people in my life and what color they are. My sister is a dead on Red for instance. Throughout all the chapters of Surrounded by Idiots, I could confirm my sister is a Red in the way she handles conflict, in her body language, in how she sends emails (my sister and I are also coworkers), and in what “makes her mad as hell” as Erikson puts it.\nI am a self-proclaimed Green. My Red sister and I get along great in social situations, but when it comes to making plans… that is a different story. Erikson talks about how the different colors work together and what challenges they may face starting on page 193. This got me thinking more about work related relationships, and I’ve got to say, Erikson is completely right in his assessment of collaborating colors. I won’t spoil all the details for you, but again it brought up situations I’ve been in with coworkers, etc. You may be able to tell from what I’ve written so far, but it was extremely difficult for me to not think of every single person in my life (work or social) and how they match up with the different colors in this book and the relationship I have with people of each personality type. This was enjoyable to me.\nErikson touches on many character traits, in work and social situations, of all four colors and how they communicate with the other colors – hence the more descriptive part of the title. He also gives plenty real life examples of coworkers of his or friends of his and their interactions. This made it realistic or relatable to me. I will say, it is kind of hard not to get defensive or think “nu uh, you’re wrong Erikson!” when he describes the weakness of the color(s) you identify with most. But keep in mind, and Erikson will remind also remind you, we are all human and no one or one personality color is perfect or superior. Overall, I very much enjoyed reading Surrounded by Idiots even though it was not the book I thought it was when I hit “buy with one click” on Amazon. As a teacher, I would highly recommend this book to other teachers because you will think of certain students or coworkers who are Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue as you read and get insight on how to work with them in a productive and empathetic manner. I’d give the book a 4.5/5. (I’d give it a 5, but it touched on some of my Green insecurities). The book is $14.99 here on Amazon and is 270 pages in length.",

        "comment": "This book describes four behavior types by sorting them into colors: red, blue, green and yellow. People that are sorted into these behavior types typically exhibit the same characteristics. For example, the book claims that green individuals are typically laid back and sometimes struggle to make decisions. Since teachers need to be able to understand and manage behavior, this book can be a foundation for how we interpret different social situations with students. While Erikson does point out that we should not use this classification method on children, it does give us some background knowledge on students and what drives behavior (e.g. environment).\nThere are many aspects of the book that I enjoyed. The book begins with a description of how and why he and his father began classifying behavior in this way. They used what is called the DISC method to establish these four behavior types. He explains that most people are a combination of two or three behavior types; very few people are just one type. Erikson describes the basis of behavior – what causes us to behave in the way that we do. He then moves on to provide an overview of the system, listing characteristics of each color in a diagram provided on page thirteen. After this introduction, he dives into how we can recognize each behavior type, how each behavior type deals with stress, which behavior types are best suited to work together, how to give feedback to each behavior type and so on. In chapter nineteen, Erikson provides examples of how people who have been sorted into the different behavior types react to different questions about their behavior and the book. Each of these people who were interviewed have read the book and are able to explain how they feel about the portrayal of individuals who belong to the group they do – most of them seem almost annoyed. For example, Hakan seems annoyed that the interviewer points out what he says is contradictory. The book ends with an interactive quiz, which is perhaps one of my favorite parts. It allows the reader to self-assess and determine what they took from this book and how they (now) understand the different behavior types.\nWhile there are not many things that I would change about the book, there are some pieces that could help provide some clarity for the reader. I loved how each behavior was talked about in detail; however, there were some parts where I really had to stop and think about what behavior was being talked about and reflect on what was said about that “color” chapters beforehand. This was likely due to the fact that it would spend the course of four chapters talking about each behavior type individually in relation to one concept or situation. It may have been better for the author to adjust this so that each situation was talked about for a single behavior type. For example, perhaps chapters four through nine could have talked about just green behavior, describing the different situations, scenarios and ideas that are discussed for that behavior throughout the book. This was not a huge issue since there were a variety of visuals, but it may be difficult for some readers who lack reading comprehension skills or have problems organizing information in their minds.",

        "comment": "This is a great reference to figure out one reason why people are behaving the way they are. It has plenty of examples, and suggestions for how to approach people more successfully based on their traits. My only hesitation is that it’s too easy to make assumptions and stereotype based on only this aspect of personality. “Oh, he’s just a yellow.” Is that true, or is there something specific to how he’s behaving that’s more important? There are a lot of areas where we can categorize people — generation, education level, social status… where all the people in that group behave in a similar way. This is a very valid one, but I would have liked to see at least a nod to some of the other ones as well. When we did this exercise at work, I noticed that there were people I thought were great in all four categories, and people I thought were… less great in all four.",

You need to learn the science of people.   As a human behavior hacker, Vanessa Van Edwards created a research lab to study the hidden forces that drive us. And she’s cracked the code. In Captivate, she shares shortcuts, systems, and secrets for taking charge of your interactions at work, at home, and in any social situation. These aren’t the people skills you learned in school.

You’ll learn, for example…  · How to work a room: Every party, networking event, and social situation has a predictable map. Discover the sweet spot for making the most connections. · How to read faces: It’s easier than you think to speed-read facial expressions and use them to predict people’s emotions. · How to talk to anyone: Every conversation can be memorable—once you learn how certain words generate the pleasure hormone dopamine in listeners. When you understand the laws of human behavior, your influence, impact, and income will increase significantly. What’s more, you will improve your interpersonal intelligence, make a killer first impression, and build rapport quickly and authentically in any situation—negotiations, interviews, parties, and pitches.

Vanessa has a way of speaking light into your spirit that encourages you to hone in on your natural strengths and get real about what you want to share—and hear—in conversations of every kind. She cracked the code and helps people master the system. I am very thankful for this collection of stories and statistics, along with Vanessa’s clever writing style.

        "comment": "Right before starting this review, I noticed that that some of the negative reviews for this book took issue with Van Edwards tone in this book, one that include the sort of corny pop culture jokes that the \"funny\" person in a cubicle space like to throw around, knowing that other \"funny\" people will laugh, and everyone else with give a polite laugh so as not to seem rude. My attitude towards jokes in books, both fiction and nonfiction, is that I don't care so long as it doesn't interrupt the pacing. Bad jokes don't upset me unless they're mean-spirited. But I actually get their purpose in this particular book:\n\nWithout the goofy jokes and whimsical examples Van Edwards would sound like a psychopath.\n\nI don't intend this as an insult, I found a lot of the advice in this book very helpful, it's just that these sort of tactics and preparations for social interactions are normally employed by pick up artists, salespeople, and the aforementioned psychopaths. There's plenty of unsavory people who have contempt for the human race but have a desire to extract value from others through interaction.\n\nThe reason I could tolerate Van Edwards version of this is that she genuinely seems to have good intentions with this information, usually encouraging shy, introverted, and awkward people to find ways they can adapt to social situations without giving up a part of themselves or running themselves ragged. She continually advises the reader to approach these social situations with open eyes and an open heart, and not to do anything that would conflict with their comfort, safety or morals.\n\nI am very tall and looming, tend to look angry, and have a lot of anxiety in social situations, so there's plenty in here I intend to try out (the cheatsheets and cartoon microexpression cards are a helpful addition) so I'm willing to look past the dorkiness since the contents seem useful.",

To let this he seen we have to shine the light on others and in the process we see the greatness in ourselves through the reflect.\n\nLetter:\n\nhope this e-mail finds you well. I am really enjoying the book... Slow reader so just up to the decoding now. The book has really helped me out. I am fairly intellectual so I would always try to showcase myself. I thought I could make friend by showing my value. How wrong was l. I need to show them thier value. I love people, but I would come off arrogant. This eventually lead to me having no friends and a divorce after 20 years (sadly I didn't even see it coming).\nHowever, now am an Uber driver and I can try out your techniques with my snack size friends (I love Fight Club) and it is amazing. I love hearing about peoples lives and we share a bond in the short time together.\nI work hard at finding threads and asking why (I have not made it to 5 yet...sorry). It makes for an enjoyable ride for all and I have been asked to hang out afterwards and my tips have increased. But beyond that it has helped make ligit connections, something I always desired, but have done incorrectly (or I found a technique I could eliminate).\nI look forward to many friends and a loving family.\n\nSincerely,\nMatthew\n\nPS- Thank you it was amazing. The more fucus I put on others the more they said I was wondering. I was gushing not knowing what to do. I had that time of attention in 15 years. And from people I just met. They said I just moved to the rank of number one Uber drive! (Which was odd because one of the friends was an Uber driver but I didn't want to split hairs).\nPPS- Sadly, I didn't know how to take a compliment. All I could think to say was...\"Aww... You would do the same to me.\"",

        "comment": "\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki is an extraordinary book that has truly changed my perspective on money, wealth, and financial literacy. This insightful and empowering read presents invaluable lessons that the rich teach their children about money, contrasting it with the mindset and beliefs commonly held by the poor and middle class. Allow me to share my experience with this life-changing book.\n\nFirst and foremost, the knowledge and wisdom imparted by Robert Kiyosaki in \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" are eye-opening. Through relatable stories and personal experiences, Kiyosaki challenges conventional beliefs about money and unveils the fundamental principles of financial success. He emphasizes the importance of financial education, investment strategies, and building assets to create lasting wealth. These powerful lessons have inspired me to take control of my financial journey and make better choices for a prosperous future.\n\nThe storytelling approach used in this book is exceptional. Kiyosaki narrates his childhood experiences, highlighting the contrasting financial mindsets of his own \"poor dad\" (his biological father) and his \"rich dad\" (his friend's father). This storytelling style effectively communicates complex financial concepts in a relatable and engaging manner. It makes the book accessible to readers from all walks of life, regardless of their prior financial knowledge.\n\nThe practicality of the lessons presented in \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" is noteworthy. Kiyosaki not only shares insights but also provides actionable steps and strategies for readers to implement in their own lives. The book encourages readers to think critically about their financial decisions, challenge their beliefs about money, and take proactive steps towards financial freedom. It serves as a practical guide for individuals seeking to break free from the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck and create a solid financial foundation.\n\nFurthermore, the book's emphasis on financial literacy is of immense value. Kiyosaki stresses the importance of acquiring financial knowledge and understanding the different forms of income, assets, and liabilities. This focus on education empowers readers to make informed financial decisions and take control of their financial destinies. It serves as a wake-up call to the significance of financial literacy in achieving long-term wealth and financial security.\n\nThe impact of \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" extends beyond personal finance. It challenges societal norms and encourages readers to question the traditional path of education and employment. Kiyosaki promotes entrepreneurship and encourages individuals to think outside the box, take calculated risks, and embrace the opportunities that come with financial independence. This book has the potential to reshape one's mindset and open up a world of possibilities.\n\nLastly, I must commend the author for his ability to inspire and motivate readers. Kiyosaki's writing style is engaging, passionate, and thought-provoking. His genuine desire to empower others to achieve financial success shines through every page, making \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" a truly transformative reading experience.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" is a must-read for anyone seeking to gain financial knowledge, reshape their mindset, and create a solid foundation for long-term wealth. Its empowering lessons, relatable storytelling, practicality, emphasis on financial literacy, and inspiring approach make it a book that has the potential to change lives. I highly recommend \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" to individuals of all ages and financial backgrounds. Pick up this book, absorb its wisdom, and embark on a journey towards financial independence and abundance!",

        "comment": "It's funny that, in the book, Robert tells a story where he referred to himself as a \"best-selling author, not a best-writing author\". That could basically be a review of the book. The concepts and mindsets encouraged by the book can be revelational, but you sometimes have to pick the valuable points out of the narrative nature of the book on your own. I found that many of the lessons in this book, I had already incorporated into my life and kind of considered to be common sense but I still got a ton of value out of the book by deeply analyzing some lessons like \"your home is not an asset\" or that the first milestone in wealth generation is to own assets that generate cash flow to sustain your lifestyle indefinitely, the latter of which could have been explained in more detail in the book because my study partners missed it. Discussing this book with a friend or study partner helps.\nThis book is a must-read for everyone. I immediately started applying these principles in my life and already feel like I have much more control and a clear path to long-term wealth.",

I nodded my head in acknowledgement but never bothered to buy and read Rich Dad Poor Dad...until now. What Kiyosaki teaches about the three different incomes and assets versus liabilities is spot on. I am working towards positive change now...I only wish I had bought and read this years ago when my wife first recommended it.",

    "synopsis": "The story of the iconic Anheuser-Busch dynasty, written—for the first time—by a Busch heir.As an heir to the Anheuser-Busch company and fortune, Billy Busch was raised on the real stories of how his family built one of America’s oldest and most iconic brands. Since the company was formed almost 150 years ago, the Busch family, their beer, the famous Clydesdales in their advertising, and even their style of business have become a symbol of the American dream—that not-so-outdated belief that hard work, grit, and a positive can-do attitude make anything possible.Growing up on the family’s ancestral estate as a prince to the King of Beers, Billy lived a life only kids could dream up—living in an amusement park, traveling by private rail car and yacht, and playing with his pet elephant, Tessie. But as he grew up, he realized that the Busch family legacy was not just wealth and privilege. With no separation between family and business, Billy’s father—more boss than dad—continued the tradition of preparing the next generation for corporate leadership, with high and exacting standards for his children. For Billy, all of this, combined with a dysfunctional family environment, was all too normal.Family Reins tells the story of a legendary American family, their rise to power, and their fall from grace through poisonous infighting, succession struggles, and a seemingly endless string of tragedies, scandals, and loss.",

Lately, I have noticed myself struggling to do things I have done just fine in the past. I started thinking that I spend too much time on my phone, I procrastinate, I feel like I am owed down time when I get off work.... I could go on. But I also noticed I have dreams I want to work on, but couldn't find the push to do so. For the past 2 nights I have put down my phone and read this book. I honestly couldn't put it down and I finished it last night. As you would expect, there is a lot of common sense in here, but it also has a lot of great techniques that can help you get over the mountains placed between you and your dreams.\nI will definitely be looking into his other books and some of the others mentioned in this book.

As I worked toward completing a Master's in Educational Counseling, my discipline took a backseat. I'd burned out with reading assignments. The 80/20 rule has given me a great perspective to continue. I have respect for setting a better schedule after reading this book. Most importantly, the way Daniel grabbed my attention on every aspect of my life struggles from losing weight, exercising, and taking on coworkers' assignments. Self-discipline is required to move forward. This book was the motivation I needed to regain focus and structure. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",

    "synopsis": "#1 international resilience expert Dr. Taryn Marie Stejskal provides practical tools to effectively address challenges, complexity, and change. Resilience is categorically misunderstood. It’s not merely about bouncing back, and it’s so much more than returning to where you began. True resilient “doing” allows us to capitalize on the inescapable challenges of life and become better than we were before. Dr. Taryn Marie Stejskal began working with brain injury patients and found that most popular beliefs about human resilience are incorrect. Since then, for the last 20 years, she has conducted qualitative research on the power of resilience, studying the science behind why some people succeed while others fail. Here, Dr. Taryn Marie outlines the five critical behaviors that define successful resilience: Vulnerability, Productive Perseverance, Connection, Gratiosity (Gratitude and Generosity), and Possibility. Resilient People bounce forward, take an active approach to facing challenges, and most importantly, they are made, not born. Dr. Taryn Marie’s empirically proven framework shows us how to develop resilience practices in our own lives—as adults, as parents, and across organizations—in a manner that allows us to be enhanced by our experiences, not diminished.",

        "comment": "Where to even start with 'The 5 Practices of Highly Resilient People' by my friend, Dr. Taryn Marie Stejskal? This book is the real deal, folks.\n\nTaryn has always had this knack for making you see your strength, even when you're convinced it's gone. She's helped me in ways that are hard to put into words, and now she's sharing her wisdom with the world. The amazing thing is, as you read this book, you realize that the power of resilience is already within you. Taryn just shows you how to harness it and make it even stronger​1​.\n\nIn her book, Taryn talks about five key practices to enhance resilience. She tells us to embrace challenges and see them as opportunities to discover our strengths and wisdom. It's not about avoiding problems, it's about facing them head-on and growing from them​1​. One of the most powerful things she taught me, which she also emphasizes in her book, is this idea of 'bouncing forward.' It's not about getting back to where you were before the adversity; it's about using the experience to propel you forward into a stronger, wiser version of yourself​1​.\n\nOne of the most useful exercises she introduces is the 'reverse bucket list.' It's an exercise in self-reflection, where you list things that have shaped you, including losses, health scares, and even fears. It's a powerful way to acknowledge your past and see how it's made you who you are today​1​.\n\nThe book is a breeze to read, but don't let its simplicity fool you. It's packed with powerful insights and practical exercises that can truly transform your life. This isn't just a book to read; it's a tool to help you navigate life's rough seas with confidence and resilience.\n\nTo wrap it up, if you're looking for a way to strengthen your resilience and flourish in the face of adversity, this book is a must-read. Taryn is not just sharing theories; she's sharing a part of her life, her experiences, and her journey. And trust me, it's a journey worth joining.",

        "comment": "This book provides both a clinical and holistic view that empowers the reader to discover deep personal truths and ultimately cultivate more resilience in a rapidly changing world. As a narrative but also a guide, the book offers practical strategies to overcome a variety of areas that hold us back. I particularly like the section on vulnerability bias and the need to integrate self-care for personal and professional growth. While this might sound obvious, Dr. Stejkal’s style warms the point a bit to feel more engaging especially in subsequent chapters in exploring our concept of worthiness in the things we think about let alone act on.\n\nMost of the chapters break concepts down into effective techniques to develop healthy habits and coping mechanisms, enabling readers to navigate adversity with strength and grace.\n\"Resilient Living\" also highlights the transformative power of genuine connections and social support. By cultivating strong social networks, readers can tap into their innate capacity for growth and adaptation, fostering a fresh perspective on resilience.\n\nBy the end of the book, if you stayed true to your own journey, you will likely feel a bit more accomplished on both recognizing the ways in which you deny vulnerability and dampen resilience, but also where you might not be doing a good job in how you relate to other people’s struggles with the same issues. The book talks about empathy and a concept of ‘productive perseverance’ which is key for individual relationships but especially to teams working together to understand both how to get things done, but also give space to ideas, emotions, and the signals that foster long term ways to work effectively and with impact.",

        "comment": "\"The Five Practices of Highly Resilient People\" by Dr. Taryn Marie Stejskal is a powerful and inspiring book that provides practical advice and tools for building resilience in today's fast-paced world. Dr. Stejskal draws on her extensive experience as a coach and consultant to offer insights and strategies that can help individuals and organizations thrive in the face of adversity.\nOne of the things that make this book so valuable is the Dr. Stejskal’s focus on the importance of self-awareness and self-care in developing resilience. She emphasizes that resilience is not just about bouncing back from setbacks but also about taking care of ourselves physically, emotionally, and mentally.
