Robert Oppenheimer, one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, a brilliant physicist who led the effort to build the atomic bomb for his country in a time of war, and who later found himself confronting the moral consequences of scientific progress.\n\nIn this magisterial, acclaimed biography twenty-five years in the making, Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin capture Oppenheimer’s life and times, from his early career to his central role in the Cold War. This is biography and history at its finest, riveting and deeply informative.\n\n“A masterful account of Oppenheimer’s rise and fall, set in the context of the turbulent decades of America’s own transformation. It is a tour de force.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review\n\n“A work of voluminous scholarship and lucid insight, unifying its multifaceted portrait with a keen grasp of Oppenheimer’s essential nature.... It succeeds in deeply fathoming his most damaging, self-contradictory behavior.” —The New York Times",

        "comment": "I loved this book! I had only the barest knowledge of Oppenheimer, and that was from his work as a physicist. I had no knowledge of his personal life, nor his political life. I knew nothing of what was done to him. Although American Prometheus is quite long, it is a very absorbing biography. I found it difficult to put down, and over the course of the past week, it has cost me several hours of sleep. I often wondered how any scientist could have been involved in the creation of the atomic bomb, but from reading this book, I can understand the rationale behind it. It’s use, however, was a political expediency, and unnecessary, if the evidence suggested in American Prometheus is accurate. It’s hard to reconcile the scientist who was instrumental in the creation of this weapon with the man who had no responsibility for its use. I admire Oppenheimer because of his persistence in speaking out against the production of the hydrogen bomb, even though his outspokenness was part of what led to his ultimate political downfall. I must admit to having ambivalent feelings about his early political connections in many ways, but ultimately I do feel he was loyal to our country. In some ways, a triumphant life, but in others, quite a sad one. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as the life of Robert Oppenheimer.",

        "comment": "Robert Oppenheimer was the scientific leader of the Manhattan Project -- the project that developed the first atomic bombs, including the two that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At first, the scientists who developed the Bomb had at first few or no moral qualms about it. (The best history of this effort is The Making of the Atomic Bomb, by Richard Rhodes, an extraordinarily good book.) They knew that Germany was working on a bomb, and they were morally certain that if Germany made a Bomb, Hitler would use it. Developing the Bomb just looked like a matter of survival. In the event, the German bomb project came to nothing, and the Manhattan Project continued after the military defeat and occupation of Germany.\n\nOppenheimer was one of the first to question the wisdom of developing the Bomb. After the war he agitated for limitations on atomic weapons. (Surely he would be a candidate for the all-time \"Too Little, Too Late\" award.) As a result he fell foul of the pro-Bomb establishment, was prosecuted in an absurd show trial and lost his clearance for classified material, a death-blow to his career. And he died, disgraced in the eyes of many, at the age of 62 of throat cancer. (Not, as you might guess, a result of being exposed to nuclear fallout -- he was a pipe smoker -- that was what got him.)\n\nKai Bird's biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, was a revelation to me. I had not before realized what a great physicist Oppenheimer was before he became the leader of the Manhattan Project. He was one of the key scientists to flesh out the meaning of Quantum Mechanics. I already knew, from quantum chemistry classes, of something called the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which forms the basis of molecular quantum chemistry. I learned in this biography that Oppenheimer was the first to realize that Einstein's theory of gravity predicted the existence of Black Holes. (The theory of Black Holes was developed in 1915 by Karl Schwarzschild, but it is notoriously difficult to understand what the Schwarzschild metric actually means -- Oppenheimer was the first.) His intelligence was not limited to physics -- he was a versatile genius.\n\nPre-Manhattan Oppenheimer was a difficult and tortured man. He tried therapy. Bird makes the claim that therapy is not useful unless the therapist is as intelligent as the patient, and that therefore Oppenheimer never found a therapist who could help him. He could be a difficult person to get along with. As described in The Making of the Atomic Bomb\n\n'Although Segrè found Oppenheimer “the fastest thinker I’ve ever met,” with “an iron memory . . . brilliance and solid merits,” he also saw “grave defects” including “occasional arrogance . . . [that] stung scientific colleagues where they were most sensitive.” “Robert could make people feel they were fools,” Bethe says simply. “He made me, but I didn’t mind.”'\n\nAn anecdote from the same source tells of Enrico Fermi's first impressions of him\n\n'Out of curiosity in 1940, while visiting Berkeley to deliver a lecture, Enrico Fermi attended a seminar one of Oppenheimer’s protégés led in the master’s style. “Emilio,” Fermi joked afterward with Segrè, “I am getting rusty and old. I cannot follow the highbrow theory developed by Oppenheimer’s pupils anymore. I went to their seminar and was depressed by my inability to understand them. Only the last sentence cheered me up; it was: ‘and this is Fermi’s theory of beta decay.’ ”'\n\nBy most accounts, Oppenheimer conquered his demons as leader of the Manhattan Project. He became an extraordinary leader of the scientists and other workers there. Those who were there at the time speak of him with nothing but praise. He understood every detail of the research and knew every person on the project and was concerned with all of them. This behavior did not come naturally to him, but he made it happen.",

This is just an alert that if you order this book and have a tendency to not read the book for a while (months to even years later), you should immediately check your copy to make sure you have page 434.

        "comment": "Riveting and soul crushing, I couldn’t put this book down. My first time reading anything by Gregg Olsen. I’m not well versed in non-fiction, but I thought he did a fantastic job at making me feel horrified and angry for these three sisters who grew up in abject terror of their mother and did everything in their power to just make it out alive.\nAt times I was shocked at all the times no one did anything to leave or get help. But I forget how pervasive fear is. The whole “don’t rock the boat” mentality. I should know better because I was raised by a violently turbulent mother who could be the sweetest, funniest and lovable person and in matter of seconds (always feels instantaneous) turn into the devil. I saw a little bit of myself in each of the sisters. The living inside your head fantasizing about revenge or better yet leaving them behind and forgotten for good and then the sicker and more confusing part of you that still loves them and yearns for the unconditional love in return. But this mother was unhinged 24/7 and completely unredeemable. EVIL.\nThese children were conditioned their entire lives by this “master manipulator” (gaslighting a very powerful tactic) that this is what family is. This what’s normal behavior. But they knew deep in their souls that this wasn’t right. The children I could understand. They were too afraid to speak out because they had been taught that they had no where to go. Their worse fear was that no one would believe them (because sometimes they had a hard time believing, “aka understanding” it themselves) and being brought to even greater heights of torture in retaliation. What I had trouble fathoming were the so called adults.\nI suppose that shouldn’t have shocked me either, because I’m more than aware that most adults don’t have it all together and can live the majority of their lives in a perpetual state of ignorance. It’s so easy. Out of sight out of mind and all that nonsense.\nBut some people, like Shelly, who was referenced as an apex predator throughout this story had that uncanny ability to sense and then weed out the very vulnerable. People who needed a friend. Were given the barest of minimums in kindness and support and then had it all taken away. By that point they were already in too deep to really understand what they had gotten themselves into. Broke my heart. There are so many lost souls in this world just trying to figure things out and at the same time willing to give everything they have to offer to others. Making it easier to be taken advantage of, which would be bad enough.\nBut these unfortunate souls had the bad luck to make contact with Shelly. And be sucked into her abyss of gaslighting, finger pointing and violent rhetoric that had everyone under her roof a husk of their former selves. And that’s what she thrived off of. Like a vampire sucking the life out of her intended victim. She’d drain them of their confidence, free will and any sense of purpose until they were as empty as she was.\nIt’s hard to imagine that some people are just born evil. But I 100% believe that Shelly is one of those people. Maybe she’s missing something in her brain that provides the ability to truly empathize with others and know what it means to do right by someone other than themselves. But Shelly lacked all of the qualities that make us truly human. I know we all have the ability to be savage and take on the world when we’re being cornered. But Shelly, even as a little girl relished in her ability to be rotten.\nThere was a family history of abuse and neglect. Maybe it was in the blood or learned behavior? Maybe it was too late for Shelly to change by the time she was already brought to live with her estranged father at 6 years old? That’s terrifying.\nThere are no answers as to why this woman did what she did. It’s frustrating that so many people were aware of the situation and did nothing, but it’s not hard to understand why. If not for her inherent laziness and her incredible sense of entitlement, she could have been the leader of a cult that took over entire communities or a country if her vision went beyond just humiliating and dominating over one person at a time. She was so very good at lying and manipulating. Not everyone bought into. But she knew how to pick her battles and who to mess with. She was always in it to win it. She just never realized that her crimes would come to light by her own daughters. Her original victims. The girls by all accounts should have been her own mirror images. But they were born with a conscious. And after years of trying to make it out and stay out they could finally do the one thing that was never an option before. Stand up to the monster.\nI’m emotionally wrecked after reading this. But it’s paced so well and the subject matter really hits home. Triggering for sure, but written in a way that makes it hard to put down. Sorry for this incredibly long and irrelevant review.",

After they misused, abused, and TORTURED Kathy, I certainly didn’t see someone ELSE falling into that trap! Poor Ron! I almost am coming to my own conclusion that possibly these two (Kathy and Ron) may have had some serious mental problems where perhaps they felt they NEEDED to be watched over or cared for….? And they just did whatever they were told too! With very LITTLE resistance, if that is in fact true, and isn’t just a fabrication…? I don’t know…the book does dive into a lot of details and all, but not so much into why they did the things they did… the only excuse was always, NIKKI you’re prancing around here like a WHORE and you’re a bad influence, or KATHY NEEDS TO LEARN! So we going to water board her real quick! Like why would ANYONE just lie back and take that?\nKids , being young and vulnerable, and not knowing any better I could totally understand, but not a consenting adult…… unless they either had mental issues themselves… or unless they were feeding them drugs , which I guess they did mention that somewhat…\nBut the only things they really mentioned was the anti depressants.. and I’m sorry but Anti-Depressants aren’t going to make someone abandon their core beliefs and make you just want to give up on life, not to the point where you’re being told to go on top of a shed roof, jump off, jump off a second time, a 3rd, and a 4th…… umm sorry but I have a hard time believing some of it… but regardless this was a truly horrifying endeavor to have to live through! I couldn’t even imagine what the girls were thinking! God Bless them!",

It's such a horrifying, crazy tale that it almost seems unreal, that it must be fiction, and yet it is an indescribably detestable nightmare of truth.\n\nOlsen did an incredible job bringing the story to life. Not just Shelly, Dave, and the children, but their home life, their family visitors, the abuse, the fear, and everything in between. The things that occurred in that household are inhumane and despicable. Truly, Shelly Knotek deserved far worse than she recieved.\n\nMy only issue with the writing was the back and forth through time. At times, it made it harder to follow what was going on as the reader is forced to determine what point in time the story is at and what already transpired. The back and forth would not have been so bad were it just each part that began again at a specific date and moved forward through time. However, even between chapters within a single part the timeline would go back and forth, requiring the reader to pay close attention to what the date is in order to maintain a clear frame of reference. It was not a deal breaker, but it simply makes it harder to read with ease.",

Just horrible and makes me understand why so many children and adults are afraid to come forward. I’m glad the youngest Tori was able to finally go live with her sister and get out of the abuse. Just sad that it took so long.\nOverall, I’m glad all the sisters are speaking out and letting the world know all the cruel thing their mother did to them and others.

    "synopsis": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of Killers of the Flower Moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. The powerful narrative reveals the deeper meaning of the events on The Wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire.\n\n“Riveting...Reads like a thriller, tackling a multilayered history—and imperialism—with gusto.” —Time\n\n\"A tour de force of narrative nonfiction.” —The Wall Street Journal\n\nOn January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty’s Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as “the prize of all the oceans,” it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes.\n\nBut then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes – they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death—for whomever the court found guilty could hang.\n\nThe Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann’s recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O’Brian, his portrayal of the castaways’ desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann’s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.",

        "comment": "It seems to me there have often been romanticizing of sea voyages of the 17th, 18th, and even the 19th centuries. Perhaps with exception of Mutiny on the Bounty, movies of larger than life heroes and brave captains fighting off pirates never fully depict the horrible reality of life on any of those warships. David Grann’s detailed story of the doomed Wager voyage quickly puts an end to any romantic fantasies of life at sea. Ships then were crowded , dark and filthy. Living\nquarters were extremely small, cramped, hot and putrid smelling, infested with rats and other vermin. They were often leaky with constant need to pump seawater out. Stouthearted hardworking sailors in those days endured such\nthings, as well as, poor and sometimes rotten food, They often became gravely ill with scurvy.\nThis is the backdrop for an ill fated mission and a series of bad decisions, unimaginable violent storms, and a stubborn mission blinded captain who won’t concede to the reality of failure once the Wager is shipwrecked. Despite the desperate living conditions and having no ship, he irrationally pushes to find a way to continue the mission of capturing a treasure laden Spanish galleon. The tedium of the crew’s brutal fight for life in it’s excruciating detail as days, weeks and months pass bring the reader into a fuller understanding of the conditions and what they endured.\nA number of men, including the captain, eventually survive. In various separate small groups each with their own first hand versions of the events eventually stagger back to England where they face Court Marshall. The intricacies of the Court\nMarshal, its final decision and what happens to the individuals make for a gripping ending.\n\nThe book is full of fascinating facts that the reader probably hasn’t encountered before. It reads at times like a novel. A 4 star adventure story",

        "comment": "David Grann, an award winner non-fiction author, has done his best to tease out the facts of the history of the British vessel, the Wager. Britain was at war with Spain. In 1740, the re-fitted merchant ship, Wager, joined a fleet setting out to capture a Spanish galleon loaded with treasure. The galleon had been sighted off the coast of Patagonia. Many on the Wager were enlisted naval men, but most were \"pressed\" into service and were of questionable character. On route, typhus killed the Captain and many of the original crew. Other sailors succumbed to scurvy. A young, inexperienced Captain, David Cheap was put in command of the Wager. Severe storms in the Strait of Magellan in addition to faulty navigation techniques, caused the Wager to shipwreck on a desolate island. There were sailors, who could not swim and they drowned in their attempts to swim ashore.\n\nThe survivors were weak, starving and frightened. Many were angry at the Captain and blamed the shipwreck on him. Three sects formed: those loyal to their Captain, those loyal to the gunner, John Bulkeley, and those loyal only to themselves. Captain Cheap did his best to keep a \"stiff upper lip\" and impose the chain of command codified by the British Navy. Cheap shot and killed one sailor for stealing from their meager food supplies. This deepened the rift and strife among the factions.\n\nSeparate groups sailed for home at different times and some made it to Britain. Once the history of the Wager was revealed, a court-martial tribunal was formed against the mutineers. If found guilty, they would be hanged. In the end, all were acquitted. Was this a \"white-wash\" by the British naval court or a moment of compassion and contrition? Several of the survivors wrote their own accounts of the wreck of the Wager. Between the embellishments and omissions to save their own necks and their naval careers, the sailors published their yarns. Grann deserves kudos for trying to present the many sides of this naval\nepisode.",

        "comment": "In 1740, Five ships, including the Wager, sailed with a fleet of five under Commodore Anson to confront the Spanish and capture a galleon with a fortune in gold and silver. They pretty much knew where she’d be, off the coast of Patagonia, and they would have to sail through the tempests of the Strait of Magellan.\n\nBefore they could start, they had to wait for the restoration being done on The Wager, which had previously been a merchant ship, and they needed to find a crew. Eventually they had to settle for some of the dregs of society, and they would pay for it later.\n\nOnce at seas many of the 2,000 men contracted typhus and Anson lost many men before he could even attempt to sail through the straits. Once they landed in Brazil another plague attacked the crew, scurvy, a lack of Vitamin C, which took more men than typhus had and weakened the others.\n\nLieutenant Cheap a subordinate officer on board the Centurion, Anson’s flag ship, ultimately became captain of the Wager, when the original captain died of scurvy. Once inside the strait, the Wager lost site of the rest of the fleet and was bombarded by the winds and the storms, losing more men yet. Once they exited the strait they were confronted by more high winds and the Wager suffered a shipwreck. Cheap and the men on board made it to a spit of land that would later be called Wager Island.\n\nThey soon ran out of food and the men began to starve. They broke off into factions. They could have been saved if they had treated the Indigenous tribe that tried to help them better. Ultimately the Indians disappeared. Cheap wanted to take the long boat from The Wager north to reconnoiter with Anson at an arranged site. They tried several times but the storms drove them back. Bulkeley, the respected gunner’s mate on board the Wager, led a faction that wanted to go back across the strait and try to find the original landing spot in Brazil. Mutiny resulted, and Cheap went so far as to kill one of the seamen.\n\nEventually some of these men returned to England and faced court martial. Bulkeley kept a journal that he published as a book. It became one of David Grann’s sources, but there were several other books published that used not only Bulkeley’s journal but Cheap’s account of what happened. They were all extremely popular.\n\nOne of the sailers a Midshipman named Byron stuck with Cheap after joining Bulkeley’s group for a brief time. His grandson was the famous poet Lord Byron.\n\nAll you need to do is check out Grann’s acknowledgments, bibliography and Index to learn how hard this guy worked on this book. He should get another mention National Book Award. He’s already been on “60 Minutes”. That’s why I read the book.",

After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.\n\nThen, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.\n\nAs the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J.

White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.\n\nLook for David Grann’s latest bestselling book, The Wager!",

        "comment": "American history is loaded with episodes of shame. A large percentage of our less memorable moments, as a nation, have been swept under the rug, kept out of classrooms, and largely forgotten as time progresses. But these events are real and all it takes is a skilled author to bring the lost history back to life. Such is the case with Killers of the Flower Moon.\nI did not know anything about these murders against the Osage until I read this book, so this was a definite eye- opener for me. I had heard of the Osage tribe, yes, but I did not know they fell into tremendous oil wealth and, subsequently, saw their members slowly dying off, either through gunfire or poisoning, as greedy individuals tried to get their hands on some easy cash. The book details several of the known killings and the cold, callous, calculated murders are chilling and puzzling. Chilling, because of the gruesomeness of the murders; puzzling, because of the nonchalant behavior of those who plotted the killings. Even when confronted with the murders, most of the guilty individuals seem to have no remorse at all. They don’t even perceive what they did as immoral in any way.\nThis book reads like a mystery thriller, however it isn’t a page- turner, like some mystery genre books. You do start to make guesses as to who is responsible, but rather than get wound up in the who- done- it, the book grips you more for its educational aspects. You learn all sorts of things about the Oklahoma region that the Osage called home. You learn about the newly formed FBI and its role in solving the mystery. You learn about the problems of racism and the feelings of superiority that people felt against Indians. And you learn just how evil people can be when vast amounts of wealth are at stake.\nThere are several surprises in this book, and one is the book’s final section. The book leads you to believe that the mystery has been solved and it sounds like everything is coming to a close. Then suddenly, the book continues for dozens more pages as the author tries to solve more of the mystery on his own, with the aid of local Osage tribe members. No one will ever know exactly how many people were killed during this reign of terror but I like how the author took it on himself to investigate and try to answer more questions.\nThis book is another solid, educational wakeup call on the prevalence of racism and superiority that pervaded society in the past and is rearing its ugly head once again today. I like how the book includes pictures so that you can get to know the many characters involved. With so many names and so many people involved, it’s easy to lose track of who is who. The pictures help you put a face with the name. But the most important part of this book is its educational value. It’s another sad, shameful episode from America’s past and one that we all need to know about and, hopefully, learn from.",

        "comment": "Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann\nNew York: Doubleday\n$28.95 - 339 pages\n\n“The whites have bunched us up down here in the backwoods,\nthe roughest part of the United States, thinking ‘we will drive these\nIndians down to where there is a big pile of rock and put them there\nin that corner.’” Now that pile of rock has turned out to be worth millions\nof dollars; now everybody wants to get in here and get some of the money.”\n--Osage Chief Bacon Rind.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of David Grann’s Killers of the Flower Moon is the fact that despite the author’s painstaking research, and his marvelous use of period photographs and documents, this factual account of historic events attending “The Osage Murders” contains the atmospheric suspense and tension that is normally associated with a classic murder mystery. In fact, Grann has written a murder mystery - One that asks who methodically killed hundreds of Osage Indians during a four-year reign of terror (1920-24). Osage history reveals the tragic details of how and why.\n\nForced to move from Kansas to Oklahoma, the Osage tribe seemed to be destined to lives of abject poverty when they suddenly found itself catapulted into a world of excessive wealth. Oil is discovered on tribal land. Suddenly, every member of the tribe is potentially wealthy. In an attempt to control the chaos that ensued, the federal government created a document called a “headright” which gave each Osage household legal rights to the oil on their land. After a period of uncontrolled spending in which members of the Osage tribe acquired mansions and fleets of automobiles, the government attempted to control the excessive spending by establishing a “guardian system” which assigned a “legal guardian” to each Osage family.\n\nThis “guardian” (usually a white banker, businessmen or “civic-minded citizen” was given the power to approve or deny all expenditures for the Osage tribal member (who had been judged to be “incompetent”) by the government. The system was badly flawed, and many of the guardians used their position to embezzle huge sums of money. In time, the guardian documents became bargaining chips in investing in business ventures. Hundreds of guardians used their position as a means of acting as a “middle-man” who would purchase items on behalf of Osage tribal members. The guardian would then sell the item to the Osage for an inflated price. For example, guardians could purchase automobiles on behalf of the Osage tribal member for $250 and then sell them to the Osage member that they represented for $2,500.\n\nAs the wealth of the Osage grew, so did the schemes for exploiting the tribe. Hundreds of criminals were drawn to the region with schemes designed to acquire a portion of Osage wealth. Many of these new arrivals openly stated that they had come to Oklahoma “to marry an Osage squaw.”\nIt was a method that frequently succeeded.\n\nHowever, some of these opportunists sought a more direct method: murder. Author Grann’s research discovers one individual, William Hale who had arranged for the murder of 24 members of the Osage tribe. By soliciting the help of associates, Hale became one of the wealthiest men in Oklahoma. The astonishing catalogue of slaughter is carried out by men willing to resort to any means to accomplish Hale’s goal. Dozens of victims were poisoned with tainted moonshine and corrupt medical personnel performed autopsies that listed “acute alcoholism” as the cause of death. Others were dispatched with a bullet to the back of the head or between the eyes and the victim’s body was found in his new car on a remote road. One family was killed by a dynamite blast that demolished their home. Often, Hale simply paid an assassin to kill a designated victim. Then, Hale would frequently hire a second assassin to kill the first. In those instances in which murderers were apprehended, Hale bribed juries and law officials and if all else failed, he simply paid another killer.\n\nTime and time again, government agents are assigned to investigate and in some instances, just as they uncover significant evidence, they are murdered and the evidence destroyed. One dedicated investigator called the FBI headquarters to report that he was on his way back with conclusive evidence against Hale. The next day his mutilated body is found near a railroad track. He had been murdered and thrown from the train. Another investigator’s body was found in another state, hundreds of miles away. What is most disquieting about the crimes in Killers of the Flower Moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in the book. State and government officials, medical personnel and lawyers - all are contaminated with the vice of greed. The corruption is so pervasive, the few moral and courageous individuals seem helplessly outnumbered.\n\nHowever, there are two remarkable people in this gruesome tale. One is Molly Burkhart, and Osage who survived the systematic murder of her family...murders in which her husband was implicated. Molly was diagnosed as a diabetic by two doctors who poisoned her insulin injections, in an attempt to slowly kill her. Molly survived and divorced her husband. The second remarkable character is Tom White, the FBI agent that pursued Hale until he brought him to justice. Much of the credit of for this amazing piece of investigative work went to the Director of the newly-created FBI agency, Hubert Hoover who turned out to be a man dedicated to his own self-interest. Through much of the investigation conducted by Tom White, Hoover managed to take credit for White’s courageous work. Jealous of any publicity directed toward agents other than himself, Hoover invariably succeeded in manipulating the factual data to his advantage.\n\nThis is a remarkable work. Most noteworthy is Grann’s comprehensive account of the primitive nature of investigations in a time before forensics emerged. As a consequence, much of Tom White’s heroic pursuit of a villain who seemed to have the protection of most of Oklahoma’s judges, lawyers and public officials. However, Grann’s greatest achievement is the fact that he uncovers evidence that the total number of victims in the Osage murders exceeded the original 24 and possibly exceeded over 200.",

        "comment": "I am a big fan of Lisa See and have read all of her books except one. I enjoy her writing style, her meticulous research, and her unfailing attempt to bring people, places, and periods of history that few people know much about to life.\n\nOn Golden Mountain was her first book and is the story of her family’s immigration to the US from China in the mid-19th Century. Family is an understatement, however, as the patriarch, Fong See, had four wives, one of which was Caucasian, and each had multiple children. By the time she gets to her own generation, therefore, the family tree is inconceivable, made all the more confusing by the fact that many Westerners have difficulty with Chinese names. A graphical family tree would have been immensely helpful but, alas, the Kindle version that I read does not have one.\n\nUnlike See’s other works, this is not so much a novel as it is a journal. In fairness to the author, however, she never promises anything else. She states, in fact, that her family was and is really quite ordinary, although she is right that there is “a lot to be learned from the ordinary and it’s that very ordinariness that links my family to all American families.”\n\nHer family did, however, face incredible hardship as a result of extreme prejudice on the Golden Mountain (the US). Sadly, that story continues, if not for the Chinese (although it still exists for them far more than you might realize), then for the same people chasing the same dreams who simply hail from a different origin and by sheer happenstance of birth happen to have a different skin color.\n\nAlthough I am an American Caucasian by birth I have lived, off and on, in China since 2007. I currently live in Beijing. And one of the reasons I have so enjoyed Lisa See’s work is that she is one of the few authors writing in English that seems to fully comprehend the difference between Western and Chinese culture. It’s a difference not just of traditions and habits but of worldview and perspective.\n\nYou won’t find as much of that insight in this book, but again, that wasn’t her purpose. And while it is a bit long, it had to be given the size of the clan and the number of generations covered. I have found that Chinese culture (and the way they drive) is guided more by the rules of flowing water than the discrete rules and traditions of Western culture. I suggest, therefore, that you will enjoy the book more if you don’t worry too much about who is related to whom. It’s the flow of the lineage that’s important.\n\nOne reward for reading to the end, however, is that See finally reveals the family member that she is related to. That was obviously deliberate. She clearly deduced that once the reader knows the other characters will not carry equal significance and she wants to tell the family’s story, not just hers. Very clever. I have to admit, however, that as I read the book I found not knowing a bit of a distraction. The question hovered in the back of my mind throughout and gave me the uncomfortable sense that there was something that the author was withholding from the reader. I ultimately concede to her decision, however. It was the right one.\n\nIn the end, the author notes “nothing has been more important or precious to me than my family being proud of me.” And, “What I learned from writing On Gold Mountain is that all that really matters in life is family, tradition, and love.” And that lesson resonates throughout the book. It is the book’s ultimate theme.\n\nSo if that is a message you can relate to or need at the moment, I suggest you dive in.",

I've known one woman whose character is similar to the protagonist in this book, though she never resorted to murder. The collateral damage left in the evil wake of Sharon Nelson is incalculable. So much loss. It's a tragic story, told well. You won't be able to put it down, I assure you.",

    "synopsis": "One fateful winter night, a famous racehorse mysteriously broke his leg while alone in his stall. An investigation ensued, but the real story has never been told…until now.\n\nIt was a cool, quiet evening at Calumet Farm, where the most valuable racehorses—including the prolific stallion Alydar—had settled into their stalls for the evening. Alton Stone, filling in for the regular night watchman, completed his rounds at the barn. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary, an inexplicable hunch led Stone to check on Alydar. What he found—a grievously injured horse with no discernible cause—jump-started one of the biggest mysteries to ever hit the horse racing world.\n\nOne part true-crime investigation, one part evocative history of the adrenaline-filled days of horse racing’s golden age, Broken follows Alydar’s rise to fame and then dives into the sordid details of the crime and trial that came to define his legacy. Told with the taut pacing of a legal thriller, Broken investigates Alydar’s death, the $41.5 million insurance payout, and the stain it left on the sport of horse racing.\n\nThroughout, animal law attorney and author Fred M. Kray weaves together shocking testimony and key evidence from the trials, featuring dramatic photos taken the night of the incident. Drawing on interviews conducted with more than twenty-five key witnesses, Kray reveals insider-only details and, in order to discover the truth about the death of this magnificent horse, embarks on a major investigation—one that leads to an unexpected and startling conclusion.",

        "comment": "This book is nonfiction that reads like a mystery...I knew that name of this horse but I did not know the drama and ongoing controversy.\nI should reveal that I have known the author for years...back in the day when he was a trial lawyer so I suppose that I am not entirely unbiased but...I loved this book.\nI don't usually read much non fiction but this book is highly readable and tells an interesting, suspenseful story. The research is extensive and includes the difficulty in finding witnesses and then persuading them to talk. Kray did an excellent job explaining how that worked and the personal toll of the frustration.\nOf course, the backstory about Alydar is very important and it makes the event even more heartbreaking. It seems that while he had dedicated trainers there was an underlying issue regarding the treatment of the horse. It's easy to forget that these horses are a valuable investment and it is expected that they get results. In Alydar's care it wasn't that he lacked results, it was the financial need of the owners who treated him as a piece of property.\nI cried during the description of what happened to the horse..cruel doesn't even begin to describe the whole event. Kray lays out the evidence and we get to analyse and come to conclusions...we are not nudged either way even though I know the author has his own opinions!\nI highly recommend this book...it is interesting, well written and readable.",

There should be do doubt that someone was responsible for his death, too many coincidences. JT Lundy was an evil, despicable man who is burning in hell. What he did to Calumet Farm was horrendous, that including Alydar.\nMy wish is that Calumet Farm will open to the public so many could visit this historic farm and give our condolences to Alydar. He deserves remembrance and recognition of his accomplishments.\nThank you Mr. Kray for defending Alydar.",

    "synopsis": "Winner of the 2009 National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography and a New York Times bestseller: a prize-winning, critically acclaimed memoir on life and aging —“An honest joy to read” (Alice Munro).\n\n\n\n\nHailed as “a virtuoso exercise” (Sunday Telegraph), this book reflects candidly, sometimes with great humor, on the condition of being old. Charming readers, writers, and critics alike, the memoir won the Costa Award for Biography and made Athill, then ninety-one, a surprising literary star.\n\n\n\n\nDiana Athill was one of the great editors in British publishing. For more than five decades she edited the likes of V. S. Naipaul and Jean Rhys, for whom she was a confidante and caretaker. As a writer, Athill made her reputation for the frankness and precisely expressed wisdom of her memoirs. Writing in her ninety-first year, \"entirely untamed about both old and new conventions\" (Literary Review) and freed from any of the inhibitions that even she may have once had, Athill reflects candidly, and sometimes with great humor, on the condition of being old—the losses and occasionally the gains that age brings, the wisdom and fortitude required to face death. Distinguished by \"remarkable intelligence...[and the] easy elegance of her prose\" (Daily Telegraph), this short, well-crafted book, hailed as \"a virtuoso exercise\" (Sunday Telegraph) presents an inspiring work for those hoping to flourish in their later years.",

        "comment": "A life lived fully, and the conclusion is: no God, infidelity is okay if no one gets hurt; focus on your life--on self.\n\nOn marriage, Ms. Athill's justification for infidelities are the two extremes, radical Islam, where a woman brings shame on her family unless she is put to death, or infidelity is, as the French believe, \"perfectly acceptable if conducted properly.\"\n\nHer conclusion between a man and woman is basic animal behavior.\n\nMs Athill, does not believe in God. She calls herself an achiest. This was crystallized by the comment of a casual lover many years ago: \"...might not be that beginnings and endings are things we think in terms of simply because our minds are too primitive to conceive anything else?\"\n\nShe believes after 91 years on earth that to believe in God means \"smallness and boring...even frightening.\" She further concludes, \"People of faith so often seen to forget that the God who gives their lives meaning too often provides them with justification when they want to wipe out other people who believe in other Gods, or in nothing.\" Believers created beliefs, or these Powers, so they could turn to them for direction and control behaviors. \"The mechanism was a obviously necessary one in its time...\"\n\nBut a few sentences later she says, \"Right behavior, to me, is the behavior taught me by my Christian family...I have accepted Christ's teaching partly because it continues to make sense.\"\n\nShe does a great service by sharing the simple truth that we're never too old to learn something new. Nor to old to make new friends in the process. She gives deep space to gardening. Her touching struggles to give up driving, and facing the memories of having to take her own Mother's car away. Her horrific accident where she was spared even a scratch but the fiasco to get her car off the road combined with malfunctioning police radios to her sudden \"general physical malaise\" suddenly resolved in a cup of \"sweet hot tea!\"\n\nSadly to this reader, she settled into life being \"the other woman,\" and takes no accountability for any of these men's failed marriages. I guess when you're in your 90's you find peace where you can.\n\nAnd then there is Barry. She never married the sap, but now he's old and sick and she's stuck. Poor Barry with his penchant for morphine. She's spot-on with the \"humilities of illness.\" Her non-husband ends up on a catheter when his urinary system goes south...and refuses to use the toilet with a nurse, and saves a Mt. Vesuvius blow-out for her to clean, which she does with detachment.\n\n\"She no longer feels the need to ponder human relationships-particularly love affairs.\"\n\nShe claims not to regret being childless, but her story made me sad. She became pregnant at 43 but had a miscarriage, apparently this child's loss in her life nearly killed her, both physically and emotionally. But there was another pregnancy that she terminated \"without hesitation or subsequent unhappiness.\"\n\nShe sums up the experience as believing if she'd had a child she would have been a good mother. And she lives in peace because she \"can't have the hassle of close involvement...\n\nUltimately, after 91 years, she concludes a long life is about luck. Who and where you were born, and in the end dissolve into nothingness. Are lives are just interesting.",

        "comment": "When was the last time you encountered someone new and the word 'wisdom' popped into your head? Not very often lately? Me neither. Until last week. I read right through this book, \"Somewhere Towards the End,\" as soon as I finished reading right through Diana Athill's earlier book, \"Stet.\"\n\nI bought \"Stet\" because it was the memoir of a superb book editor, a job I had done once myself, though not superbly. She had been one of the founders of a small, elite British house and worked with Mailer, Vidal, and Updike to name but three of their stable.\n\nI bought \"Somewhere Towards The End\" because I was wondering what it is like to be old. I knew about arthritis, wrinkles and a sense of irrelevance. Who doesn't? I had been wondering if there was anything more appealing to be said for it. Diana Athill was close to 90 when she wrote this book, and the answer she personifies is 'Yes, there is.'\n\nYou see from the first page that she herself is a wonderful writer, a very unusual writer, and she must have been hell on wheels as an editor. (Not in the way you may be thinking though; Gordon Liss she is not. Her insights are penetrating, but her touch is very light., just short of self- effacing.) She embodies more than a few paradoxes. She she did not bring the kind of clear, rational insights to her own personal and financial life that she invested in her authors' books. She is quite frank about it, but never self-pitying. Fortunately for the reader, she made interesting mistakes with interesting people. One of the things that charmed and fascinated me is how lucidly and candidly she writes about her misadventures.\n\nOne minute she seems quite eccentric and the next you may realize that you've done the same thing for the same reason but never quite admitted the latter to yourself. She is extremely discrete about the affairs of others but not at all politically correct about her own sexual history. Nor does she romanticize the emotional history that went along with it. And outlives it.\n\nI hope I have done this book and this writer justice. She has had a real impact on the way I look at some things, and I hope many others will get the same opportunity.",

        "comment": "I think what I liked best about this book is its absolute frankness. Athill has nothing to hide. She knows she has done certain things in her life that are perhaps less than admirable or honorable, and that she can be, and often is, quite selfish. So what? She cites the example of 103 year-old Alice Herz-Sommer, also a professed atheist, who said -\n\n\"We are born half good and half bad - everybody, EVERY body. And there are situations where the good comes out and where the bad comes out. This is why people invented religion, I believe.\"\n\nAthill does admit to having some regrets, but refuses to dwell on them. She is simply grateful for the life she has had and amazed that she's lucky enough to still be here. Which makes sense to me.\n\nAfter more than fifty years as an editor in the publishing business, Athill became a successful memoirist in her seventies and eighties. And she makes no bones about her joy at this: \"... easily the best part of my old age has been, and still is, a little less ordinary. It is entirely to do with having had the luck to discover that I can write.\"\nShe goes on to tell how much enjoyment she has gotten from her late-found celebrity, however minor it might be. Having published my own first book at the age of sixty (and three more since then), I can relate. It's been a kick. This is a fascinating little book about growing old, and not at all sad or negative. I'm glad I found it, and plan to pass it along now to my mother, who at 93, is a year older than Diana Athill. I'm sure she'll like it too. Who knows, maybe it will nudge her into writing more about her own life. I hope so. Go for it, Mom. - author of the REED CITY BOY trilogy and LOVE, WAR & POLIO",

    "synopsis": "INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n#1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER\n\nThe BELOVED STAR OF FRIENDS takes us behind the scenes of the hit sitcom and his struggles with addiction in this “CANDID, DARKLY FUNNY...POIGNANT” memoir (The New York Times)\n\nA MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK by Time, Associated Press, Goodreads, USA Today, and more!\n\n“Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead.”\n\nSo begins the riveting story of acclaimed actor Matthew Perry, taking us along on his journey from childhood ambition to fame to addiction and recovery in the aftermath of a life-threatening health scare. Before the frequent hospital visits and stints in rehab, there was five-year-old Matthew, who traveled from Montreal to Los Angeles, shuffling between his separated parents; fourteen-year-old Matthew, who was a nationally ranked tennis star in Canada; twenty-four-year-old Matthew, who nabbed a coveted role as a lead cast member on the talked-about pilot then called Friends Like Us. . . and so much more.\n\nIn an extraordinary story that only he could tell—and in the heartfelt, hilarious, and warmly familiar way only he could tell it—Matthew Perry lays bare the fractured family that raised him (and also left him to his own devices), the desire for recognition that drove him to fame, and the void inside him that could not be filled even by his greatest dreams coming true. But he also details the peace he’s found in sobriety and how he feels about the ubiquity of Friends, sharing stories about his castmates and other stars he met along the way. Frank, self-aware, and with his trademark humor, Perry vividly depicts his lifelong battle with addiction and what fueled it despite seemingly having it all.\n\nFriends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing is an unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-opening—as well as a hand extended to anyone struggling with sobriety. Unflinchingly honest, moving, and uproariously funny, this is the book fans have been waiting for.",

        "comment": "I'll admit, I rarely watched \"Friends\" when episodes first aired. My wife started binge watching it a couple years ago or so, probably during the pandemic, and so I started watching it with her. I do think that I was a little too hard on the show though as I always thought that it was a bit of a \"Seinfeld\" \"rip-off.\" In reality there are enough differences in the shows that now, after watching the entire series of each, I've relaxed my criticism. A bit.\n\nAnd I rarely read autobiographies, or what people usually call \"memoirs\" nowadays. I usually am reading true-crime books, in particular those about serial killers. I did read \"C'mon, Get Happy: Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus\" (CGH) from David Cassidy in 2021 and I actually liked Mr. Cassidy LESS after reading his memoir. I kind of wish I wouldn't have read CGH and just remembered him instead from his time on the show. It's just that I found Mr. Cassidy to be a bit of a braggart while reading and while I finished CGH I was struggling to even care towards the end. I'm guessing that Susan Dey felt the same. Ahem.\n\nNow, rarely does Matthew Perry \"brag\" during \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir\" (FLB) about himself. He does discuss how much money he made during filming of \"Friends,\" and I don't have a problem with that, mostly because he discusses how David Schwimmer actually was instrumental in negotiating a great deal for the entire cast and not just for Mr. Schwimmer. In reality Mr. Perry is far more self-deprecating in FLB than Mr. Cassidy is in CGH. Mr. Perry doesn't seem to hide much when it comes to his struggles with addiction and if he does underplay it, well, he must be REALLY bad. Mr. Perry discusses how he was taking up to 55 pain killers a day and that is extreme. For those who don't know, pain killers tend to dry you out and slow down digestion so I have no idea how someone could take that many for any length of time and survive.\n\nWell, Mr. Perry almost didn't survive.\n\nMr. Perry was rushed by a friend from one of his many stints in rehab to the hospital and the people running the rehab facility tried to stop him. If they had been successful Mr. Perry surely would've died. Heck, he still should've died in the hospital even though he had probably the best care that money could buy. From memory he said that only \"two percent of people survive on the machine required to keep him alive,\" and I think he also called it a \"Hail Mary.\"\n\nOverall I really liked FLB and I actually read it in one day. As a matter of fact I couldn't sleep last night and kept picking up my Kindle device and would continue reading. Usually readers might say, \"I couldn't put it down!\" but I might say, \"I couldn't leave it down.\" Over and over I picked up my device, opened the Kindle app, and continued from my last bookmark. Luckily for me Kindle apps save the bookmark for me and that's only one of the reasons I tend to almost only read digital. I will buy a paperback or a hardcover version but only if I MUST read a book and there is no digital version.\n\nBut still FLB is not a \"perfect book,\" far from it. Towards the end I think that Mr. Perry starts to repeat himself and I got the feeling that he was on a tight deadline and just hammered out the last few chapters. I don't know if he first created an outline -- I think that all authors should do so at an early phase in writing -- but I think a good outline would've really helped create a more polished effort. It's also the case that Mr. Perry has a tendency to use too many parentheticals and that becomes a bit of a distraction for the reader.\n\nNot that it bothers me but it might bother some readers: Mr. Perry does discuss religion, or at least God, quite a bit towards the end. If religion is a turnoff, I think that FLB may not be for you. Mr. Perry does seem to think that God helped keep him alive, maybe even helped him break some addictions, and that is fine by me. I can't prove it either way, and it is Mr. Perry's memoir, so he has a right to think and write whatever he chooses. Personally, I appreciate his honesty.\n\nMr. Perry does admit going into open houses and swiping pain meds from home sellers and that reminded me a lot of Ryan Leaf. I think that Mr. Leaf used to do the same thing and it got that ex-NFL player quite a few years in prison for it. From a legal standpoint if I were Mr. Perry, and I were writing a memoir, I think I might not have disclosed this. I am not a lawyer and I don't know what legal troubles it could cause him now.\n\nThere has been quite a bit of noise about how Mr. Perry tends to \"kiss and tell\" and I think that's overblown a bit. He does discuss how he and Valerie Bertinelli made out within just a few feet of Eddie Van Halen, after Mr. Van Halen had passed out from drinking too much wine. Hey, I guess I've been there myself so I won't judge. Um, from Mr. Van Halen's perspective and not necessarily from Mr. Perry's. But Mr. Perry doesn't really dwell on it too much. I can understand how Ms. Bertinelli feels about the disclosure although of course Mr. Van Halen is no longer with us. If Mr. Van Halen were still alive I believe that Mr. Perry probably wouldn't even bring it up. Just a guess.\n\nWell, if you're a fan of \"Friends\" and Matthew Perry, and you like to read memoirs, I'll give a fairly strong recommendation for \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.\" If you don't fit that criteria perhaps you might want to read something else. But if you're a fan of David Cassidy from \"The Partridge Family\" I'll recommend you pass on his memoir. Sometimes it's better to only remember the good things about your heroes, after all.",

        "comment": "Gosh. When Matthew Perry said that he incorporated bits of himself into the role of Chandler Bing, he was so under exaggerating. Not just the sarcasm, not just the failure at women, not just the smoking (good God, the smoking), but, man, every bit of Bing goes a long way from the mind of Matthew. How he managed to take the stage every episode for 10 years and be completely “ON” will leave you absolutely stunned. And make him even more of a comedic genius than he already was. Because aside from his appearance (in his own words, skinny meant pills, fat meant booze) it would be virtually unnoticeable as his performances were never affected.\n\nThis book really leaves you with a “I don’t know what how to feel about this book” feeling at the end of it. For the most part due to the way it just jumps all over the place in terms of time and sheer self-destruction. One minute you’re rooting for MP as he achieves his hopes and dreams of sitcom super (or, “stupor”) stardom. To the next minute wanting to go up to the Hollywood Hills (or whatever house he’s living in this month, he changes houses like people change socks) and slap him in the head and say, “What the hell is the Matthew matter with you!”\n\nThat being said, it’s not like any of this went undocumented back in the day. No matter the amount of trouble he found himself in, there’s no way that I couldn’t read this, as I consider Perry in the same upper echelon ranks of physical comedic performer as a John Ritter. And has always reminded me delivery wise of a Michael Keaton (whom he cites as his favorite actor, by the way, so I guess that makes sense). What he brought as a performer, and not just Chandler but everything he does, is an inherent (or inherited?) ability to not just expertly time his lines and incorporate a facial reaction, but his particular physical movements were something to behold. Never forced, never stolen, it was all him with the gesture of an arm or breaking into a pee-inducing dance of hilarity, he was of the Michael J Fox (another guy he mentions in his book) school of comedy: you give the guy one joke, he gets three laughs.\n\nI mean, I go back with this guy as a viewer. From his minor role in A Night in the life of Jimmy Reardon, to when he died on Growing Pains. Which I found a bit of a disappointment, that he never mentioned his time on that show. Especially for somebody who suffers from such a horrendous alcohol addiction, as his character actually drunk drove himself into the hospital and subsequently dies, leading to one of the more disquieting moments in the show’s history when his death is revealed.\n\nNow, addiction is addiction, but the almost braggadocios way he wears it like a badge of honor becomes nearly unbearable. He nearly turns it into a drinking game. Every time he says he took 55 Vicodin, you take a shot. Every time he says he got scared of being close to a woman and ditched her, take a shot. Every time he tells you how beloved Friends is and that he changed the vernacular of the entire country (which I lived through and do not remember), take a shot. You’ll be dead before chapter 12.\n\nThere are numerous moments of uplifting achievements, which are only to be negated a sentence later due to utter lunacy and illogical reason. It qualifies him as something of a medical marvel because they ARE of reason to an addict. The bit about scavenging the homes for sale I thought was his dastardly pinnacle. But the flying back and forth to Switzerland officially reaches evil genius status and definitely takes the cake (or flan). And just when you think he is on the right track he derails just one more time into the same repetitive, self-destructive patterns again and again. Which brings the book to its most aggravating aspect as it becomes so incredibly redundant about only halfway through. Even to the point where either Perry while in writing mode was still sifting through his lucid moments, or it was his editor who was the one popping pills. Because several passages word for word (including the infamous Keanu Reeves statement) get repeated a handful of times throughout the book to where YOU end up screaming at your Kindle, “is it him or am I the one who’s crazy??”\n\nBut as far as the uplifting stuff there’s, of course, his relocation from Canada in his teens and his slow-burn rise to fame with all of the 80s either guest appearances or failed pilots. Right to the point of the Chandler audition, which actually cost him a close friendship because a buddy of his was up for the part, resulting in the two not speaking for three years. Ah, but then comes the fun house of fame, fortune and f***king (LOTS of f***ing f***ing. I think he banged more girls than Joey!), all of which he doesn’t fail to mention to you at least once a chapter as to the quantity of how much brain he gave away.\n\nAnd, in the biggest “Yet” of “Yets,” somehow ends up at his laptop in the modern day telling us this exact story, even after a years-of-abuse perforated bowel that nearly killed him. Which can only leave you in the end so very concerned for his future, a future that he’s really drawn up for himself in terms of eventually finding solid love and having babies. Though only 53, who knows how much of that future he will actually see.\n\nSo, Mr. Matthew Langford Perry, aka Chandler Muriel Bing, thank you for opening up to us. Even if it did re-define the very picture of hopeless and awkward and desperate for love (his words, not mine).",

    "synopsis": "A front-of-the-house Kitchen Confidential from a career maître d’hotel who manned the front of the room in New York City's hottest and most in-demand restaurants.\n\nFrom the glamorous to the entitled, from royalty to the financially ruined, everyone who wanted to be seen—or just to gawk—at the hottest restaurants in New York City came to places Michael Cecchi-Azzolina helped run. His phone number was passed around among those who wanted to curry favor, during the decades when restaurants replaced clubs and theater as, well, theater in the most visible, vibrant city in the world.\n\nBesides dropping us back into a vanished time, Your Table Is Ready takes us places we’d never be able to get into on our own: Raoul's in Soho with its louche club vibe; Buzzy O’Keefe’s casually elegant River Café (the only outer-borough establishment desirable enough to be included in this roster), from Keith McNally’s Minetta Tavern to Nolita’s Le Coucou, possibly the most beautiful room in New York City in 2018, with its French Country Auberge-meets-winery look and the most exquisite and enormous stands of flowers, changed every three days.\n\nFrom his early career serving theater stars like Tennessee Williams and Dustin Hoffman at La Rousse right through to the last pre-pandemic-shutdown full houses at Le Coucou, Cecchi-Azzolina has seen it all. In Your Table Is Ready, he breaks down how restaurants really run (and don’t), and how the economics work for owners and overworked staff alike. The professionals who gravitate to the business are a special, tougher breed, practiced in dealing with the demanding patrons and with each other, in a very distinctive ecosystem that’s somewhere between a George Orwell “down and out in….” dungeon and a sleek showman’s smoke-and-mirrors palace.\n\nYour Table Is Ready is a rollicking, raunchy, revelatory memoir.",

        "comment": "Had I stayed in the business I would have been the third generation in my family to run high end restaurants. I hated the business. I hated it for all the reasons some people love it. Michael Cecchi-Azzolina's descriptions are absolutely accurate. The performance anxiety, the stress, dealing with insufferable guests, working crazy hours and schedules and being the last line of defense if something goes wrong or an employee doesn't show up are all part of the job. All this is explained in detail in Michael's memoir about his 35+ years working every front of the house job in the high end restaurant business in New York City. He loved it. He was able to make it fun and gratifying. He did crazy stuff, dealt with all the absurdities, lived through successes and failures and still wants more. His writing style is smooth and easy to read. His stories are often bawdy. He describes incidents which defy belief, but you just know they're true, of things that happen when people eat, drink and generally let their hair down while out to have a good time. And, because he worked in some of the most popular and expensive restaurants in the city there is plenty of celebrity gossip. I particularly enjoyed the book because of my personal history. I would recommend it to those who want a behind the scenes look, warts and all, of what appears to be a glamorous business. The stories are lots of fun and will be enjoyed by most.",

Afterall, who doesn’t want to know about the restaurant industry in NYC? Maybe I would find out why dining is so expensive in the city. Maybe I would find out if the average waiter makes enough to pay exorbitant rents. Etc, etc.\nInstead here’s what I learned: A small town girl had no clue about big city goings on in mob controlled NYC in the 80’s and 90’s. Sex, drugs, homosexuality and STDs were rampant in the restaurant world. It was a dog eat dog business. It was a rivalry between front of the house and back of the house staff. Famous ones were magnets for celebrities where they were treated accordingly to tip.\nIt was a behind the scenes world of debauchery. It was stunningly awful to read.

It was an honest book and it was interesting and entertaining. I enjoyed his many references, they revealed how knowledgeable he is, or, at least, well rounded and smart.

    "synopsis": "* #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER * MORE THAN 2 MILLION COPIES SOLD!\n\nA heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.\n\nJennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.\n\nIn I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.\n\nTold with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.",

Jennette McCurdy pulls no punches as she recounts her childhood as a child actor and her complicated relationship with her mother, who was narcissistic and abusive.\n\nThe book has a few giggle out loud moments, but it is also deeply moving and heartbreaking. McCurdy writes with unflinching honesty about her own experiences with eating disorders, addiction, and abuse. She also writes about her journey to find healing and self-acceptance.\n\nI learned so much about the acting industry from this book, but that wasn't the main takeaway for me. What I really appreciated was McCurdy's vulnerability and her willingness to share her story with the world. She is a gifted writer with a down-to-earth voice, and she weaves her story together with skill and compassion.\n\nIf you are looking for a book that will make you laugh, cry, and think, then I highly recommend I'm Glad My Mom Died. It is a powerful, easy to read book that will both keep you engaged and make you reflect about how things are not always as they seem and we don’t know what’s really going on in anybody else’s life.",

The author eloquently detailed her experiences she had with her mother - which I truly feel sorry for the author. There are many upbringing's like her's where the child has to get line - and follow orders from their parents - but managed the situation gracefully. Parent's in general hardly get any accountability for their actions - and I believed the author exemplified the best manner to express her feelings in this thoughtful, funny, and well written book.",

My heart goes out to Jannette and I am so glad she is in better control of her life. Children are dependent on their parents and a parent is supposed to have their child's best interest at heart, always. Some people should never have had the awesome gift of being a parent. Janette was able to recognize, change, and and begin overcoming such and upbringing. We are all human, thus flawed and imperfect.

    "synopsis": "The classic memoir of the Italian city left in chaos by the Nazis is “[a] masterpiece . . . elegiac and furious, and frequently hilarious” (The New York Times).\n \n“Vivid, lucid, elegant, often funny,” Naples ’44 is the starkly human account of the true cost of war as seen through the eyes of a young, untested man who would never again look at his world the same way (The New York Times Book Review).\n \nWith his gift for linguistics, Norman Lewis was assigned to the British Intelligence Corps’ Field Security Service, tasked with reforming civil services, dealing with local leaders, and keeping the peace in places World War II had devastated.\n \nAfter a near-disastrous Allied landing at Salerno, Italy, Lewis was stationed in the newly liberated city of Naples. But bringing the city back to life was unlike anything he had been prepared for. Much of the populace was far from grateful, stealing anything they could, not only from each other but also from those sent to help them. Local vendettas and endless feuds made discerning friend from Nazi collaborator practically impossible, and turned attempts at meting out justice into a farce. And as the deprivations grew ever harsher, a proud and vibrant people were forced to survive on a diet of prostitution, corruption, and a desperate belief in miracles, cures, and saviors.\n \nBut even through the darkness and chaos, Lewis evokes the essential dignity of the Neapolitan people, their traditions of civility, courage, and generosity of spirit, and the indefatigable pride that kept them fighting for life during the greatest calamity in human history.\n \nPraised by Graham Greene as “one of the best writers . . . of our century,” Norman Lewis presents a portrait of Naples that is a “lyrical, ironic and detached account of the tempestuous, byzantine and opaque city in the aftermath of war” (Will Self). His Naples ’44 “reads like prose . . . sings like poetry” (The Plain Dealer).",

        "comment": "In a great profile in the Guardian newspaper in 2000 - when Lewis was already 93 - Nicholas Wroe writes that Lewis's career as a writer started when he was asked by the British Secret Services to go and photograph the Yemen. Strange then that after travelling around the region (he was actually denied entry to the Yemen!) he instead wrote and published his first book, \"Sand and Sea In Arabia\".\n\nThis in-depth exposure to Arabic, despite the author's relatively lack of formal education ... he never attended college... led to his discovering an aptitude for languages, and he was a gifted linguist, speaking French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, German, and Italian. This early entry, in WWI, into a 'spying career\" also led to his recall, in the second world war into the Field Security Service, rather than Secret Service - the author himself said, the difference being the FSO's actually \"got their boots dirty\" - and as Lewis mentions, rather smugly in the book, he was issued with a pass that bore the legend; \"The bearer is entitled to be in any place, at any time and wearing any uniform he chooses\" ...so he did indeed, just go wherever he liked, and this allowed him to get the material and experiences that he later used to write what is considered his masterpiece, Naples '44. After a rather logical deployment in North Africa, to use his Arabic, he was deployed - and subsequently, with his colleagues, totally ignored - to the USA Headquarters of General Clark for the invasion of Italy, landing at Salerno.\n\nClark was subsequently criticized by British historians and General Montgomery for the near-failure of the landings at Salerno, as a result of poor planning and at one stage, the author states, the General actually planned to withdraw from the hard-won beach-head, deserting his own men and retreating to the off-shore battle fleet. Clark's conduct of operations remains controversial, particularly his later actions in ignoring orders from his Army Group Commander and rapidly advancing towards Rome to be the first to enter and thereby allowing a large number of German troops to escape. Lewis also mentions his horror at the order passed to the troops that any Germans surrendering were to be killed - by the butts of their rifles. War, of course is brutalizing and provides the evidence that all of us can become dehumanized by it and discards our morals.\n\nBut not - by his own and his contemporaries accounts - not Lewis, who as rapidly as he becomes disenchanted by his peers becomes enamored of the Italians, those starving, grasping, mafia exploited \"scugnizzi' of Naples he meets and treats.\n\nThe author evidences his compassion and that engages ours.",

One is left with a sense of wonder, rather than horror. Lewis has an easy reading style and keeps one entranced without resorting to any unecessary violence or intrigue.",

        "comment": "Carroll & Graf paperback edition cover captures a ball capped American GI caressing the legs of a well traveled skirt lifting Italian seductress standing on a table while others look on; the \"decisive moment\" in \"Naples '44.\" One photo and a well written text can seduce the reader as well. The well known, prolific and talented English travel writer, Norman Lewis, spent from September 1943 to October 1944 in Naples as an intelligence officer for the British 5th Army. In this short, descriptive, witty diary type book, he fights gun battles with bandits, investigates the Camorra (or Mafia) and its control of the City and environs, describes the vast black market in tires, arms, blankets, penicillin, and all else, and the daily trials and rituals of the Neapolitans in surviving. Vesuvius erupts in March '45 and it is his \"most majestic and terrible sight.\" The rapes of Italian women by \"the Moors\" are rampant; one victim \"majestic in true Southern style, with a cataract of black hair, the eyes of a tragedienne and the innocence of expression that contemplates the armament of any outstanding harlot.\" He hunts fresh grass after the October rains in woods \"full of chestnuts, fungi spring up out of the damp earth, and edible plants of the order of dandelions and plantains, for use of salads, sprout among the new grass.\" His last panoramic view of Naples as he leaves; \"the great grey and red city spread below; presenting a totally fallacious aspect of dignified calm.\" Repeatedly cited by Rick Atkinson in his \"The Day of Battle,\" this book is definitive and classic.",

        "comment": "I really liked Naples ’44! I thought it was an interesting perspective on WW II, and I also really liked how most of the towns and cities mentioned in the book can still be seen today if one travels to Italy. I did, however, find it a little difficult to follow at times, and I found (at least for me), because it was written in 1940’s British English, that too at times was hard to follow. But, all in all, it was a nice read and as already mentioned it was an interesting perspective on a historical event. If you are a WW II history buff, or you really like Italy, or both perhaps, I would highly recommend this book. Even if these topics don’t strike your fancy, I would still recommend this book to others, all in all, a nice read.",

        "comment": "For those of us who know, or, more correctly, thought they knew, Italy, this book is irresistible. I fear I devoured it in 24 hours, instead of savoring it, like a good glass of cognac, sip by delicious sip. Mr. Lewis was stationed in Naples toward the end of WWII. He served as an investigator for the British Army and hence was in an ideal position to do what he does best: observe people, places, and situations that can only arise in a certain time and culture. The result is a portrait of remarkable detail and veracity. At the end of the book, Mr. Lewis has been ordered to leave Italy for Egypt. I wonder if he ever returned and, if so, what his impressons were once the country had moved past the war. It will be delightful to read more of this books. This was my first; it will not be my last!",

    "synopsis": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Discover the global phenomenon that tells an unforgettable story of love, loss, and healing.\n\n“Compellingly artful . . . [a] blockbuster memoir.”—The New Yorker\n\nIt was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking behind their mother’s coffin as the world watched in sorrow—and horror. As Princess Diana was laid to rest, billions wondered what Prince William and Prince Harry must be thinking and feeling—and how their lives would play out from that point on.\n\nFor Harry, this is that story at last.\n\nBefore losing his mother, twelve-year-old Prince Harry was known as the carefree one, the happy-go-lucky Spare to the more serious Heir. Grief changed everything. He struggled at school, struggled with anger, with loneliness—and, because he blamed the press for his mother’s death, he struggled to accept life in the spotlight.\n\nAt twenty-one, he joined the British Army. The discipline gave him structure, and two combat tours made him a hero at home. But he soon felt more lost than ever, suffering from post-traumatic stress and prone to crippling panic attacks. Above all, he couldn’t find true love. \n\nThen he met Meghan. The world was swept away by the couple’s cinematic romance and rejoiced in their fairy-tale wedding. But from the beginning, Harry and Meghan were preyed upon by the press, subjected to waves of abuse, racism, and lies. Watching his wife suffer, their safety and mental health at risk, Harry saw no other way to prevent the tragedy of history repeating itself but to flee his mother country. Over the centuries, leaving the Royal Family was an act few had dared. The last to try, in fact, had been his mother. . . .\n\nFor the first time, Prince Harry tells his own story, chronicling his journey with raw, unflinching honesty. A landmark publication, Spare is full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.",

        "comment": "I don’t really read these kinds of books. I’m addicted to sci fi and historical romance and intake most my gossip/nonfiction news from social media mediums and independent research (Tik Tok and Twitter). I don’t think I’ve ever read a biography, autobiography, or memoir outside of an educational setting. I picked this up just bc I was interested in all the weird excerpts the media put all over headlines in the days leading up. I’m also a big supporter of evaluating primary sources first-hand as my liberal arts bachelors degree taught me before I form opinions. I expected a celebrity tell-all gossip piece..\n\nBUT, this piece took my breath away. I read it in one night and went through so many emotions. I had to put it down multiple times to laugh, cry, and self reflect. Well-done to Harry taking the hard step to be vulnerable to the world in his own way and taking control of his narrative and his writer is absolutely so talented. The writer is so magnificent, I cannot say it enough.\n\nThis book is going to be analyzed in classrooms, positively, negatively, analytically one day as it touches on coming-of age, literature and motifs, the most recent war, and a love story and a social and political discourse on British press and its relationship with the Palace. People are going to be talking about this book for ages and as Meghan and Harry seem to be really polarizing to some. I recommend anyone supporter or not, British or American, read this book first and form your own opinions. Clear your mind of the bias from what you know of Harry from the press and media and read it about a story of a boy growing into a man. It’s really quite good when you look past you’re own biases.\n\nHarry’s really grown when it comes to his own biases and privilege and this book really explores that growth in a first person POV that also causes to reader to take a step back and evaluate themselves but I do think he needs to sit on his support of a Monarchy a bit more lol…it was nice as an American to understand British culture a bit more though and I feel like I was able to put myself in the other Royals shoes and humanize them as well! Since Meghan and Harry are the only ones who we’ve been able to authentically hear from as of late.\n\nI know a lot of people will speak on his chapters of his experiences in the war negatively, and to be honest. I wasn’t expecting that kind of candor and rawness and it resonated with me but in a introspectively beneficial way..as someone who is currently in the neo-stage of their military officer career (I only joined because I wanted to be a leader and get college paid but I’ve been more introspective on leadership and military more lately) I had to take military history classes when I was in college, I read many textbooks and memories who recount experiences similar to his from the civil war, Vietnam and WW1/2 perspective and we analyzed them relentlessly…but I haven’t seen a lot of memoirs from veterans from the War on Terror or from non-Americans. With the peacetime the U.S. is in I guess I doubt I’ll be serving long enough to ever experience the trauma he went through and it helps me understand the PTSD of modern soldiers and those veteran NCOs I work with. That section made me really introspective about the military and the way we’re trained and the discourse around the ethics of it even though his military experience is from a different country. (Side note this really helped me realize how important OPSEC is lol I literally screamed OPSEC at the book at one point).\n\nI enjoy the way he recounted his childhood and his relationship with his family. It was very tactful and well-written and I think every comment that a tabloid has pulled as “offensive” out of context was balanced out throughout the book as we really delved into the nuances of family and our childhoods. The people he mentions in this book are not just characters and celebrities in a show or tabloid but real people who are multifaceted and there is no antagonist and protagonist in real life.\n\nHe also kept it spicy with the funny TMI moments about his social life and ~extracurricular~ activities. The random celebrity name drops were hilarious to me with his sarcastic tone and obviously not ill-mannered or narcissistic as I saw some implied. I think that was the perfect amount of comedy and tiny factoids that are ultimately harmless and affect no one except entertain the reader. I’m a very TMI person and the way he exposed embarrassing moments is the way I talk to my inner circle of friends and I felt like I was listening to a friend tell me a story on girls night. I saw on Twitter people were offended by the TMI but let’s be honest, if he hadn’t left in the spicy/funny comments people would have just said his memoir is boring and a waste of money and money-seeking. I’m sure there are plenty of other TMI details of his life that are private and he did not share. Everything he shared that people called “TMI” is inconsequential to the audience and only there to entertain comedic relief amongst the other dark themes in this book. This probably went through hella reviews and many consultations to make sure it wasn’t too out there.\n\nI could ramble forever about this book…I wanna join like a book club or reddit to discuss it. This is truly one of my favorite reads in like the last ten years. I may have separate opinions about the Harry v. the Monarchy discourse but I just want to endorse the book is SUCH a good read anyways for those on edge.",

        "comment": "Potential spoiler alerts: This book was a fascinating glimpse into Harry’s mind. His young mother died. Not only did she die, as all mothers do, she was killed in a car accident, as happens to some mothers. Not only was she killed in a car accident, she was being chased by paparazzi, senselessly, which is unique. This was beyond young Harry’s comprehension. He was never ever able to process her death. Why, why, why? Her death plagued him, and her death still haunts him. His family was and still appears to be stoic. They aren’t a touchy feely bunch. They don’t talk about their emotions. It seems from the book they are too busy with their jobs to show their love of family through quality time. And what gifts and acts of services from family would have been meaningful to the young prince? So Harry floundered on his own without the support he needed and wanted at a critical time in his life. Had he been younger or older, perhaps he would have handled his mom’s death differently. Despite the Queen’s and his father’s reported reliance on her Christian faith, Harry said his religion was nature. This hasn’t worked out so well for Harry. Instead, he turned to alcohol and drugs. Hard to say if he has an addiction from the book. It was an eye opener to me how much alcohol and drugs he uses in his circle! (Is this what all the elite do? No wonder the world is messed up!) I guess it’s very affordable and available? He didn’t mention in the book what he does for fun. Parties seemed to be a prime hobby for him. The alcohol and drugs are of course mood altering he admits, but were they also contributing to his depression and agoraphobia? He raises lots of good questions. As far as the British paparazzi are concerned, as a not famous American, it’s hard for me to comprehend. The difference between being a famous actor and a famous prince is that an actor chose the career knowing what comes with it. Harry did not. I want to do a bit of research about British newspapers too. It’s not clear to me whether Harry was obsessed with American equivalents of the New York Times or the National Enquirer. Are all newspapers in Britain like the National Enquirer? And obsessed he was and is, based on his own words. I am on the internet a lot. I have to use a search engine to find articles about Harry. I am not bombarded with Harry articles. I go to the American grocery store. I see magazines. I also see (trash type) newspapers. I haven’t done research, I don’t have data, but don’t people by the trash type newspapers for fun? “Elvis Presley seen walking at Graceland on his birthday” Does anyone believe this stuff? So I’m trying to figure out what kind of newspapers these British papers are. Some kind of cross between a legitimate newspaper and a trash newspaper? Before reading this book, you may want to do some research first on newspapers in England. For whatever reason, Harry put a lot of value-too much value- on the crap he read about himself. It mattered a lot about what people he didn’t know thought about him. The book also makes the people of England look very stupid (which I hope they aren’t) because Harry feels that the majority of people believe and are influenced by the junk that’s published about him. I guess to some extent, a bunch of people must buy the nonsense, and therefore support the publishers. And his dad and the Queen were right about one thing: today, what is the monarchy without the “media”. If the monarchy did all of their services without the benefit of the publicity, would enough people from the commonwealth know about their good works and want to continue to support the monarchy? (If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it make a sound?) To persist, the monarchy needs publicity (bad publicity probably works as well as good publicity) like any other organization or business. From Harry’s perspective, I drew the conclusion that his relatives seem to think it’s beneath them to do legitimate interviews with legitimate news media on a regular basis. Perhaps they want to maintain an aloofness and mystique? And they spend a lot of time crafting “leaks” to the media. Why are “leaks” needed? Why are “leaks” to the press ever needed? Perhaps they want deniability? The normal sibling rivalry was reinforced and magnified hundredfold by Harry’s mom, dad, the queen, the monarchy… The two brothers would need a lot of joint counseling by someone to overcome the damage done but who has experience counseling heir/spare relationships? The book makes it seem like the family was all business unless you were part of a couple. The Queen and her husband, William and Kate, Charles and Camilla, within a small circle of two, the couples seem to relate to each other as family as well as business partners. Outside each circle, the book read like it was all business. And they all have egos to be fed. Unlike other successful family businesses, this monarchy business appears to focus more on the individual, than on the company as a whole. Unlike a sports team, it’s not about team monarchy, it’s about each super player on the team, including Harry. Just the way the company is structured is odd. The leadership of team monarchy wasn’t portrayed in the book as bringing the team together, growing each member of the team, capitalizing on strengths and overcoming weaknesses… the normal stuff a good team leader does. For instance, if it’s one company, why are their multiple PR groups sending mixed messages to the press? If I was queen haha there would be one PR group. If I found out about leaks, you would be “fired”. And if it is the way Harry described, if I was queen, I wouldn’t tolerate competitive PR teams! What a power trip those sides must be on! One person is the heir, others are spares, but until the heir becomes the next leader, why the preferential treatment within the company? Oh wait! Because the heir doesn’t have to earn the right to be king or queen, it’s given to him from the day he is born. Yes, absolutely fascinating group dynamics going on here in this unique company! A couple words about Meghan. She had a huge internet following on her own site, right? She was an influencer. And yet Harry said she didn’t google him and didn’t know anything about him or his family, and it was so refreshing. Harry also said after they hooked up, she was bombarded by the media negativity about Harry and herself, suicidal even. She didn’t pay attention before they hooked up but afterwards she paid so much attention she was suicidal?\n\nAnyway it was a very interesting read!",

    "synopsis": "A New York Times Notable Book: A memoir of the writing life of Jim Harrison, from hardscrabble years to high-profile Hollywood friendships, “as engaging as it is eccentric” (The Washington Post Book World).\n \nIn this “sprawling, impressionistic memoir”, which was selected as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, Jim Harrison chronicles his coming-of-age, from a boy drunk with books to a young man making his way among fellow writers he deeply admires—including Peter Matthiessen, Robert Lowell, W.H. Auden, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, and Allen Ginsberg (The New York Times Book Review). Harrison discusses forthrightly the life-changing experience of becoming a father, and the minor cognitive dissonance that ensued when this boy from the heartland somehow ended up a highly paid Hollywood screenwriter. He gives free rein to his seven obsessions—alcohol, food, stripping, hunting and fishing (and the dogs who have accompanied him in both), religion, the road, and our place in the natural world—which he elucidates with earthy wisdom and an elegant sense of connectedness. Off to the Side is a work of great beauty and importance, a triumphant achievement that captures the writing life and brings all of us clues for living. A true masterpiece of memoir from an author whose “writing bears earthy whiffs of wild morels and morals and of booze and botany, as well as hints of William Faulkner, Louise Erdrich, Herman Melville, and Norman Maclean.” (San Francisco Chronicle)\n \n“This fine memoir is a worthy capstone to a fascinating career.” —Publishers Weekly",

        "comment": "I started reading Jim Harrison in the seventies. I even liked the early books he doesn't. I read his poetry and kept track of his work up through Off to the Side. I subscribe to Esquire and Men's Journal so I read many of the \"Raw and the Cooked\" pieces and saw early printings of various novellas. (I read \"Legends\" in Esquire in one sitting at my kitchen table. Hey, I was born poor too) This is some context for my remarks. Who does one write a memoir for? I guess my hope is that a memoir by an author is for his readers. If you are hoping for this, you'll be disappointed. It seems this memoir was for Harrison and probably his family and a few close friends listed toward the end. As for people who have been reading his work, maybe we're just better off reading his work. When a writer writes a memoir, I am interested in understanding what he/she reads and how he/she reads. Harrison mentions a number of writers but he doesn't say much about what he got from them (except near the end when he reveals a bit of what Notes From the Underground meant for him). I am interested in how events shaped writing and thinking. What we get are anecdotes. Harrison knew many writers who I like to read but we learn nothing of interest through his encounters. Ultimately, this memoir seems to me self absorbed. As if it were time to do the \"memoir\" thing. I guess I was naïve enough to think that writers consider their readers, but I don't think Harrison knows anything about his readers except as schmucks who go to his book signings that he was trying mightily to get out of. (I've never been to a book signing.) Is Off to the Side entertaining? Yes. Is it well written in Harrison's distinctive voice? Yes. Did Harrison have a life interesting enough to write about? Yes. Do we learn anything about his writing or reading or his take on other writers and their ideas? No. The rating is higher than it probably should be, but like Harrison, I hate to admit that something I spent time on reading wasn't worth my time.",

        "comment": "I read, but I am not well read. My knowledge of literature and poetry especially is so limited as to be non-existent. My exposure to Harrison has been limited to this memoir, The Raw And the Cooked, and his appearance on No Reservations; I have no preconceived ideas about the man. I have had a hard time finishing ANY book in recent years, but I have read Off to the Side and The Raw and the Cooked right though and both in the last few weeks. I tend to regard a memoir as a self-indulgent airing of dirty laundry so I avoid them. Harrison seems to avoid anything terribly deep-feeling, and a lot of these stories strike me as almost out-of-body. The naming is tiresome only in that I know of less than a handful of these people he has encountered. I would not complain of name-dropping. There is a running thread of self-deprecation that stops you short of finding him arrogant. The stories do tend to wander in a way that will lose you if you are not fully committed to the reading; They wander the way your mind does, a line of digressions.\n\nA word about a word...I do wonder if he doesn't overuse 'banal' as an example of banality...He does tend to find a descriptor and wear it out before moving on.\n\nOff to the Side is worthwhile if you like Harrison or are curious about him.\n\nADDITION: The conversion of books to digital format generally produces an appalling result with regard to 'typos' and these books referenced here are no exception. From random commas, periods, and capitalization, to 'barn' consistently reproduced as 'bam'...Proofreading by humans is obviously not part of the conversion process. There is even an instance of some random word being started with a British Pound sign.",

        "comment": "Let me preface this by saying that I like Jim Harrison as a writer. And he is also a pretty interesting human being. Harrison is not a particularly easy writer (or person) for women to like, mostly due to his many vices and passions, such as smoking, drinking, near-gluttonous eating, and hunting. That said, I am a woman and I like Jim Harrion. But then I have smoked, drank, and eaten to excess myself on occassion; and though I don't hunt, I do fish. I love the outdoors and have played there pretty much all my life, so I can relate to a lot of what he writes about.\n\nThis book though, like a lot of his stories lately, suffers from a bit of disjointing; he skips around a lot, often not finishing a thought, then launching into a few lines that while interesting, often do not complete the though very well. It makes me wonder if the story--or the memoir--are just vehicles for the various insights and quips he's come up with while out walking. Oh his insights and zings are entertaining, don't get me wrong. But it seems like he's relying on it more an more.\n\nI do admire the man for being true to himself and his beliefs. It adds a lot if you go online and read the interviews he's done. I not only gained a greater respect for him, but it also introducted me to some new writers I'd not explored, such as Jack Turner.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this book had nothing to do with Harrison; I have the Kindle version and it's LOADED with typos. An insult to a good writer and a ripoff to those that pay to buy it.",

I appreciated his wry humor and astute ability to point out many absurdities of modern life. His self deprecating take on himself was a lesson in humility. He's a great storyteller. I would have given the book 5 stars if I hadn't been so desperate for a comma or two by the end of his long rambles. Still, it was a fascinating read.",

    "synopsis": "On Sarah A. Chrisman’s twenty-ninth birthday, her husband, Gabriel, presented her with a corset. The material and the design were breathtakingly beautiful, but her mind immediately filled with unwelcome views. Although she had been in love with the Victorian era all her life, she had specifically asked her husband not to buy her a corset—ever. She’d heard how corsets affected the female body and what they represented, and she wanted none of it.\n\nHowever, Chrisman agreed to try on the garment . . . and found it surprisingly enjoyable. The corset, she realized, was a tool of empowerment—not oppression. After a year of wearing a corset on a daily basis, her waist had gone from thirty-two inches to twenty-two inches, she was experiencing fewer migraines, and her posture improved. She had successfully transformed her body, her dress, and her lifestyle into that of a Victorian woman—and everyone was asking about it.\n\nIn Victorian Secrets, Chrisman explains how a garment from the past led to a change in not only the way she viewed herself, but also the ways she understood the major differences between the cultures of twenty-first-century and nineteenth-century America. The desire to delve further into the Victorian lifestyle provided Chrisman with new insight into issues of body image and how women, past and present, have seen and continue to see themselves.",

        "comment": "I enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend this book to others. It is a personal journey of the author, and how wearing a corset changed her life. Whereas this is not a diet book, she learned to eat better and healthier and set boundaries on how much to eat at one time. She learned that smaller meals are actually healthier for you and you can still enjoy ice cream at times. This along with her exercising (walking or bicycling everywhere) she was able to lose weight in a healthy manor and to be able to keep it off.\n\nAlso, because the corset causes you to “sit up straight,” her posture improved. Before wearing the corset the author describes herself as a less assured woman who slouched and was not noticed as much. However, once she posture had improved others perceived her as a confident, self-assured woman. The “side effect” of this is, she became that confident, self-assured woman. Another “side effect” is it appears to have to open a door to foster a better relationship with her mother.\n\nI like how she did the research on corsetery and addressed the myths like: “the removed ribs to make them that small.” I am a Living Historian and I wear a corset very often and I cannot tell you how many times I have heard that statement (and many of the other statements the author describes) and sometimes have to do some major convincing to people regarding how false these statements are. And as far as being on the receiving end of unkind statements, I understand how she was hurt by people who have been unkind to her. I have been on the receiving end all too many times. Yet she seemed to be very hard on them. It is very easy to be hard on them, but when we do, we stoop to their level and she has come too far to stoop that low.\n\nThe author, along with her husband, collects vintage clothing and has done research on them. They enjoy showing them off to the public and have received positive responses when doing so. However, with all her research, why doesn’t she talk about the chemise or wear a chemise under her corset? According to my research, and the research of many others, this was a very common practice to protect the corset from being soiled due to the fact that corsets are challenging to clean.\n\nThere was a point when I became confused. It was when the author was addressing complaints that she has received from women who have never worn a corset. Was she criticizing reenactors, in general? Or, the women who have seen reenactors wearing corsets? And, if it was the reeanctors, what were these events, where these women were seen? Were they events like Renaissance festivals, where accuracy is not always encouraged or an event like an American Civil War reenactment, where accuracy is strongly encouraged? I am a “Living Historian” but because I mostly dress in the 1860’s style it is usually at events and it is sometimes easer to call myself a reenactor (in reality the guys who portray soldiers are the reenactors because they reenact the battles.) We portray, to the best of our ability, what civilian life was like. And outside our events many of us, including me, incorporate Victorian life in our everyday life. Many of us try very hard to be as accurate as we possibly can. Yet, I am also aware of the reenactors that think they are correctly portraying history, but aren't quite there for one reason or another, but we should not all be put into a category that assumes that all of us are incorrect. And I don’t think that is what that author is saying. I think she is saying she had not encountered too many people who are familiar with corseting. My hope is as her journey continues; she gets the chance to meet more people that want, and try very hard, to portray history accurately.\n\nAnother story that the author shared was the one of the little Russian lady. It was cute story and I understand why the lady had trouble believing that the author was getting enough to eat. I have a dear friend that has Slavic blood in her and, as my friend informs me all the time, \"I have the need to feed.\" It was cute that the author was referred to as a little doll.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful book with interesting stories. I understand the author’s comment and feel the same way about the corset and clothing. They have never been a costume for me either. My final thought is; I hope this book will get others to think about the past and corsets in a more positive light and we can all enjoy incorporating a bit of the past into our futures.",

        "comment": "It’s not often you find a person who embodies the conservative ideal in a book about women’s undergarments. Indeed, Sarah A. Chrisman doesn’t even make direct political points in her book Victorian Secrets, What a Corset Taught Me about the Past, the Present, and Myself. Instead her comments about individual rights, truth in opposition to falsehoods and the value of the best from the past speak for themselves. If conservativism means anything, it means conserving knowledge and that Ms Chrisman does in spades in this wonderful, brave, readable book.\n\nMs, actually Mrs., Chrisman is a smart (degrees in International Studies and French from the University of Washington), eco-friendly, individualist with an interest in historical clothing. When her husband gave her a corset for her birthday she was at first curious, then intrigued and finally convinced our great grandparents were on to something.\n\nHer experiences wearing one for a year forced her to revise her ideas on the Victorians of all classes and forced her friends and enemies to examine their own prejudices about the female form. Repeatedly she would be approached by complete strangers and complimented on her figure. This happened so often, and so persistently, it became a standard part of any excursion from her home. She would also be accosted by others, invariably women, and accused of being a traitor to women’s liberation and a dupe of misogynistic males. When she tried to disabuse them of the idea her corset was killing her, they accused her of lying.\n\nWhat her actual crime was, was to present the progressive liberals of LaLa land with facts with which they didn’t want to deal. They had their idea of what was right and wrong about the past and to Hell with the facts. This dichotomy between what Sarah knew from personal experience and what she was told by Progressives is the central revelation of the book. The Progressives have it all wrong about the past, all wrong about clothing, all wrong about the female form and . . . let’s be blunt . . . all wrong about facts.\n\nShe says, for example, it’s now considered racist or xenophobic to consider your own country better than another, yet “we have no word for those who treat the cultures of the past in this same manner.” Let me quote from the book:\n\n[It's been said ]“The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.” Yet foreign countries have ambassadors and diplomats to speak for them. The past is far less able to defend itself; it cannot formulate rebuttals. Perhaps that is why it is such an easy victim.\n\nThus, an opinion has become common that everything about the present is superior to anything that existed in the past. It is difficult for many people to grasp that lifestyles may have been different in the past, and yet still completely satisfactory to those living them. History has no emissaries.\"\n\nIt may have no emissaries, but now it has an ambassador, or rather, embassadress, Sarah A. Chrisman. It is richly ironic that the very women who criticize her are those who, on other topics, loudly proclaim their support for individual rights. As she says herself, they do not extend this right on issues with which they disagree. As we conservatives, and libertarians, know so well, this is typical of Progressives.\n\nI’d like to add one personal note. Sarah A Chrisman doesn’t mention motorcycling as neither she nor her husband have one. If she did, she might be familiar with what we motorcyclists call a “kidney belt,” used on cruiser type bikes for back support.This is nothing more nor less than a male corset that does exactly the same job for men as a female corset does for women: it stabilizes the back and lessens the load on the back muscles. Anyone who has ridden any distance on an unfaired cruiser with such a device will appreciate how a belt of this kind takes away pain and comforts the rider.\n\nIndeed, as a group, motorcyclists are closer to corset wearing than you might think. They are doing what Sarah A. Chrisman is doing. They are preserving a piece of history and resisting the onrush of ‘progress’ and the Progressive politics that go with it. I congratulate Sarah on her rugged individualism, her literary ability and her wasp waist. I urge you to purchase and read her wonderful book.",

    "synopsis": "“A shocking saga of pharmaceutical malpractice . . . Wonder Drug is both a first-rate medical thriller and the searing account of a forgotten American tragedy.”—Patrick Radden Keefe, author of Empire of Pain\n \nA “fascinating and compassionate” (People) account of the most notorious drug of the twentieth century and the never-before-told story of its American survivors.\n\nIn 1959, a Cincinnati pharmaceutical firm, the William S. Merrell Company, quietly began distributing samples of an exciting new wonder drug already popular around the world. Touted as a sedative without risks, thalidomide was handed out freely, under the guise of clinical trials, by doctors who believed approval by the Food and Drug Administration was imminent. \n\nBut in 1960, when the application for thalidomide landed on the desk of FDA medical reviewer Frances Kelsey, she quickly grew suspicious. When she learned that the drug was causing severe birth abnormalities abroad, she and a team of dedicated doctors, parents, and journalists fought tirelessly to block its authorization in the United States and stop its sale around the world.\n\nJennifer Vanderbes set out to write about this FDA success story only to discover a sinister truth that had been buried for decades: For more than five years, several American pharmaceutical firms had distributed unmarked thalidomide samples in shoddy clinical trials, reaching tens of thousands of unwitting patients, including hundreds of pregnant women. \n\nAs Vanderbes examined government and corporate archives, probed court records, and interviewed hundreds of key players, she unearthed an even more stunning find: Scores of Americans had likely been harmed by the drug. Deceived by the pharmaceutical firms, betrayed by doctors, and ignored by the government, most of these Americans had spent their lives unaware that thalidomide had caused their birth defects. \n \nNow, for the first time, this shocking episode in American history is brought to light. Wonder Drug gives voice to the unrecognized victims of this epic scandal and exposes the deceptive practices of Big Pharma that continue to endanger lives today.",

        "comment": "Jennifer Vanderbes's Wonder Drug is an enthralling, impossible-to-put-down exploration of one of the great tragedies perpetuated by drug companies upon unsuspecting (and trusting) victims. The drug, Thalidomide (sold and \"freely\" distributed under various names and derivatives as a sedative in the late 1950s and early 1960s), caused phocomelia (a shortening of the \"limb/s being reduced or missing and leaving distal elements (handplate) in place\" (National Institutes of Health). If you've ever seen a thalidomide baby, you've likely seen a photograph of a baby with \"flipper-like\" hands and/or feet. Many of those babies are now in their sixties; plenty died or were forgotten about once they were born, swaddled and pulled from their mothers and either put in homes or taken care of in other ways.\n\nThe William S. Merrell Company had been inundating medical facilities with pills that were causing severe birth defects, passing the pills off as remedies for such things as insomnia, morning sickness, and headaches, and it indeed felt like a \"wonder drug.\" But the truth of that wonder drug was far from what was being claimed. It soon became apparent that “ten thousand babies worldwide” at the time were killed or born with deformed limbs and/or defective organs due to the drug. As I read these facts and as a father myself, I couldn’t fathom what these parents had gone through. It angered me.\n\nThe evolution and importance of the FDA, and how it altered the safety of the American public, materialized during the time of the thalidomide tragedy. But it was a slow process.\n\nThe story of thalidomide as a tested and effective drug reviewed by doctors and scientists was horrific. From Nazi experimentation with the drug in concentration camps to a lack of due diligence by the gatekeepers of healthcare around the globe, patients seeking relief from various ailments were treated as Guinea pigs. Many of them died, yet doctors continued to prescribe the drug, even before animal testing was completed, if any testing was ever completed at all. To say that the industry dropped the ball would be to put it mildly. But no one seemed to care, except a brave, inquisitive, and tough Dr. named Frances Kelsey, who brought thalidomide's dangers to light and pushed for its halt as the drug of choice for so many doctors.\n\nThe scientific evaluations being done were too rushed, but, for the drug companies, the profits were too tempting. Inevitably, due to the rules of the game at the FDA, those testing the medications had 60 days to kill them. But 60 days often wasn’t enough time to conduct the trials. And so the runaway trains of profit over people were set free.\n\nThe reality was that the politics of the early days of the FDA and its association with the drug manufacturers it was supposedly overseeing was not what it is today. What it was during the days of thalidomide's introduction into the hands of patients can be considered criminal. Profits above human decency seemed the norm. Trials were either not performed, performed inadequately, or simply overlooked in terms of what the actual results were. Thalidomide, or Kevadon, as it was called by the drug manufacturer Richardson-Merrell, was pushed to the public the way a street corner drug dealer pushes their product to their neighborhoods—except it was much worse, because Merrell had the financial ability to market their drugs heavily, all while sending an army of detail men (sales reps) to supplement demand.\n\nTime and again, the need, or the results, of safety research, was sidelined, all for the profit of the companies hawking pills that would ultimately be proven lethal or extremely damaging, in particular to the unborn children of women given the medicine.\n\nVanderbes is brilliant at breaking down the way the medicine makes its way from the manufacturer to the detail men, to the receptive doctors or \"clinical investigators\" who would provide the drugs to their patients (these doctors were known as Dr. Backslappers), who then prescribed the meds to patients (or passed them along to other doctors, who were not clinical investigators), effectively making it impossible for accountability if anything went wrong, as the chain of custody of the medicine was lost.\n\nIn the hurricane of drug pushing for profit, ethical, detail-oriented doctors at the FDA like Dr. Frances Kelsey, sought to put a stop to the Wild Wild West days of profits over patients.\n\nYet the immorality of some of the doctors involved with the thalidomide tragedy, including a thoroughly repugnant study they executed on minors with brain damage in Bonn, Germany (where the drug was known as Contergan) is mind-boggling. That so many doctors went along with human trials of a drug proving fatal to so many will leave the reader not only astonished but wondering how such a thing could happen at all.\n\nBut what Vanderbes does so well is shed light on exactly how something so horribly wrong and unethical could happen in the shadow of WWII and in the 20th century, given all the progress the world had made. Shady business relationships between medical companies and medical journals was one factor that contributed to the problem. Another was that doctors who wished to publish their findings about the harmful effects of Thalidomide were often “delayed.” Yes, the world was different back then, but one has to ask themselves, Where was the decency? Where was the morality of all involved? Had these people and companies no shame?\n\nTime after time after time, the drug companies selling Thalidomide hid any mention of safety findings related to the cash cow drug lining their pockets. Some of the companies outright lied, or contrived ways to get around halting the sale of it, which, by 1961, was in about 42 countries. Babies were being born with extremely malformed limbs and other birth defects, and the mothers and families of these children were being kept in the dark as to why. Responsibility was a game of hot potato no one wanted to play. so no one was held to account. Not the doctors, who didn’t have to tell patients what they were giving them, nor that the drugs they were being given had reported birth abnormalities, not the drug companies, who misled the FDA, nor, it seemed, anybody else involved with the spread of the wonder drug.\n\nTo mitigate the losses that acknowledging the drug's issues might cause, A Merrell press release “affirmed that thalidomide was ‘never sold in the United States.’\" But as Vanderbes makes clear, “sold” did not mean not distributed. \"At the time of Merrell’s “premarket distribution of [thalidomide, it was] . . . the largest in U.S. history.”\n\nBut then, in 1960, things began to change. A paper was published in the British Medical Journal, and the FDA in America caught on. Merrell was eventually found to have put the drug out into the market and then suppressed data and submitted false data in its Kevadon application. More companies followed suit. Once it was abundantly clear that the house of cards would fall, Grunenthal, the German seller of the drug, settled with its affected patients, rather than go to trial. But the damage was done. 150,000 worldwide victims were affected, 45 nations had thalidomide in circulation, and, in effect, it was still the Wild Wild West on who had thalidomide and where it was still being prescribed (or given out).\n\nWhile Thalidomide was later found to be beneficial for treating certain symptoms of AIDS and leprosy, the WHO (the World Health Organization) put the kabash on its use due to “murky” research on the drug’s efficacy. Things have changed recently with how thalidomide and its variants are used, but none of this changes what happened to the thousands upon thousands of victims whose lives were either cut short or adversely affected for the duration of their entire lives.\n\nVanderbes's book is a must read, especially if you want to get a detailed understanding of how drug companies used to work (and hopefully a reminder of how things have changed since those days). It's also a history lesson in what women had to do in order to succeed in educational and career opportunities where the organizations they wanted to be a part of were overwhelmingly chauvanistic. The drug companies and even the FDA were geared towards men, directed by men, and the entire industry was controlled by the profit specific men reaped through the sale of thalidomide and other drugs. Women like Dr. Frances Kelsey and others paved the way for change. They were the champions of patients being lied to, manipulated, and physically and mentally affected by everything the drug companies in their quest for profits brought down upon them with neither their consent nor knowledge. What happened to the patients of thalidomide is horrific, and Vanderbes's book is a testament to why such a travesty should never happen again. Buy the book, and read it. Now. As a participant in the health industry, whether as a patient, a doctor, or any other role you may hold when it comes to healthcare, you should be aware of the history of thalidomide, if even just to know what to look out for any time a doctor says, \"I'd like to prescribe you this . . . .\"",

And so are a lot of my friends from U.S. Thalidomide Survivors, a nonprofit formed only a few years ago in 2018. This book is us. This book literally helped us find each other.\n\nCan you imagine wondering all of your life why you look like all of the thalidomide survivors in Europe, and asking questions of doctors all your life, but being told that the FDA never approved the drug in our country, and it was never here? Can you imagine rewriting your history when you were in your late 50s? Finally learning the truth?\n\nThat is why I say this book will change history. It already is doing so. While it was previously mis-reported that the US escaped the thalidomide tragedy, this book shows us all that it did not. It introduces new information.\n\nJennifer Vanderbes illuminates the disturbing story of how thalidomide was handed out by United States drug companies, eager to get ahead of what they thought would be FDA approval (which never came) to doctors all across the country; who, in turn, gave it out to patients who often did not know what drug they were being given. This included pregnant women. This included my mother.\n\nAnd her book goes on to show how US authorities, including the FDA, did not adequately investigate once the dangers of thalidomide were discovered. They did not track down the patients who had received it. They did not notify the unwitting victims and failed to find the babies affected.\n\nWonder Drug is a riveting read, so well-told and well-researched! The old statistics are out and the new ones are here. The casualties of this dark chapter in American history come to life in Jennifer’s book. I personally am proud she did our stories justice. Please read, share, and amplify this important new truth!",

    "synopsis": "The wild and highly anticipated autobiography of Billy Walters—“the greatest and most controversial sports gambler ever” (ESPN)—who shares his extraordinary life story, reveals the secrets to his fiercely protected betting system, and breaks his silence about Phil Mickelson.\n\nAnybody can get lucky. Nobody controls the odds like Billy Walters. Widely regarded as “the Michael Jordan of sports betting,” Walters is a living legend in Las Vegas and among sports bettors worldwide. With an unmatched winning streak of thirty-six consecutive years, Walters has become fabulously wealthy by placing hundreds of millions of dollars a year in gross wagers, including one Super Bowl bet of $3.5 million alone. Competitors desperate to crack his betting techniques have tried hacking his phones, cloning his beepers, rifling through his trash, and bribing his employees. Now, after decades of avoiding the spotlight and fiercely protecting the keys to his success, Walters has reached the age where he wants to pass along his wisdom to future generations of sports wagerers.\n\nGambler is more than a traditional autobiography. In addition to sharing his against-all-odds American dream story, Walters reveals in granular detail the secrets of his proprietary betting system, which will serve as a master class for anyone who wants to improve their odds at betting on sports. Walters also breaks his silence about his long and complicated relationship with Hall of Fame professional golfer Phil Mickelson.\n\nOn a typical weekend gameday packed with college and pro sports, Walters will bet $10 million—a small sum for someone as wealthy as he is today, but an unbelievable fortune for the child who was raised by his grandmother in extreme poverty in rural Kentucky. By the age of nine, Walters became a shark at hustling pool and pitching pennies. As a young adult, he set records as a used-car salesman, hustled golf, and dabbled in bookmaking. He eventually moved to Las Vegas, where he revolutionized sports betting strategy and became a member of the famed Computer Group, the first syndicate to apply sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to sports gambling. He became extraordinarily wealthy while overcoming addictions and outmaneuvering organized crime figures made infamous by Martin Scorsese’s film Casino.\n\nIn Gambler, Walters passes along everything he’s learned about sports betting. First, he shows bettors how to mine the information we have at our fingertips to develop a sophisticated betting strategy and handicapping system of our own. He explains how even avid bettors often do not grasp all of the variables that go into making an informed wager—factors such as home field advantage, individual player values, injuries or illness, weather forecasts, each team’s previous schedule (bye weeks, multiple away games in a row, etc.), travel distance/difficulty, stadium quirks, turf types, and more. Not every bettor has access to Walters’s team of expert analysts, but every bettor can follow his guidelines on how to measure the detailed information available online and look for unique situations that could affect a game’s outcome more than usual. Variable by variable, Walters breaks down the formulas, point systems, and principles that he’s developed over decades of improving his craft.\n\nA self-made man who’s repeatedly won it all, lost it all, and earned it all back again, Walters has lived a singular and wildly appealing American life, of the outlaw variety. Gambler is at once a gripping autobiography, a blistering tell-all, and an indispensable playbook for coming out on top.",

This alarmed authorities, who feared \"over-sexed\" women could destroy civilization, either by crossing the color line or passing their evident defects on to their children. Set against this backdrop, The Unfit Heiress chronicles the fight for inheritance between Ann Cooper Hewitt and her socialite mother Maryon, who had her daughter sterilized without her knowledge. A sensational court case ensued, and powerful eugenicists saw an opportunity to restrict reproductive rights in America for decades to come.\n\nThis riveting story unfolds through the brilliant research of Audrey Clare Farley, who captures the interior lives of these women on the pages and poses questions that remain relevant today: What does it mean to be \"unfit\" for motherhood? How do racial anxieties continue to influence who does and does not reproduce? In the battle for reproductive rights, can we forgive those who side against us? And can we forgive our mothers if they are the ones who inflict the deepest wounds?",

    "synopsis": "The #1 New York Times–bestselling author’s “hilarious . . . idiosyncratic . . . delightful” and definitive companion to a global phenomenon (Publishers Weekly).\n \nDouglas Adams’s “six-part trilogy,” The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy grew from a blip of a notion into an ever-expanding multimedia universe that amassed an unprecedented cult of followers and became an international sensation. As a young journalist, Neil Gaiman was given complete access to Adams’s life, times, gossip, unpublished outtakes, and files (and became privy to his writing process, insecurities, disillusionments, challenges, and triumphs). The resulting volume illuminates the unique, funny, dramatic, and improbable chronicle of an idea, an incredibly tall man, and a mind-boggling success story.\n \nIn Don’t Panic, Gaiman celebrates everything Hitchhiker: the original radio play, the books, comics, video and computer games, films, television series, record albums, stage musicals, one-man shows, the Great One himself, and towels. And as Douglas Adams himself attested: “It’s all absolutely devastatingly true—except the bits that are lies.”\n \nUpdated several times in the thirty years since its original publication, Don’t Panic is available for the first time in digital form. Part biography, part tell-all parody, part pop-culture history, part guide to a guide, Don’t Panic “deserves as much cult success as the Hitchhiker’s books themselves” (Time Out).",

        "comment": "It's not anyone's fault that I didn't enjoy this book any more than I did; it's actually to the credit of Mr. Gaiman and everyone else involved that I enjoyed it even this much. You see, I don't like non-fiction and, as a general rule, don't read it. For me, non-fiction gets way too bogged down in facts and too quickly forgets what makes anything worth reading in the first place; ie: a narrative thread to hang onto and someone relatable to root for. Biographies, of which \"Don't Panic\" is sort of one, gives you the second part, the \"someone to root for,\" but too often gets lost on the path to it's narrative thread by having to stick to the chronological facts exactly as they happened. I gave \"Don't Panic\" a try, however, because A) it's written about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" one of my favorite books and book series and B) it's written by Neil Gaiman, a certified genius and one of my favorite writers. If Gaiman couldn't find a way to make the story of one of my all-time favorite stories interesting, then such a thing just wasn't possible.\n\nApparently, it's not possible. Mr. Gaiman does his absolute best here, letting his own sense of humor run free against the landscape Douglas Adams created and he drops in all sorts of deleted bits of Hitchhiker's dialogue amidst the quotes from friends and collegues, but it seems here that Gaiman is so dedicated to giving Adams' story (and the stories he wrote) it's due, that he forgets, or perhaps doesn't feel he has permission to, delete the parts that are just too dry (read: boring) to keep the narrative interesting. Because make no mistake, this book includes EVERYTHING that has ever happened in the world of making The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy one of the best and funniest radio shows/books/video games/movies, etcetera and soforth and so on in the history of the known universe, and while you will learn much about the vagaries of Adams' world-famous procrastination and the corporate ins and outs of the BBC and Hollywood, you will also find yourself nodding off in points, or if not nodding off, certainly wishing the current chapter would come to an end and that the next chapter would be about something completely different. Mr. Gaiman has a deep love and appreciation of Douglas Adams and his work and if you share that love to the same extent, you will find much to enjoy in this book. However, as someone who was mainly interested in the rocky road of the Hitchhiker's Guide with a bit of Dr. Who and Dirk Gently tossed in for good measure, there's an awful lot about conservation specials and climbing Mount Kilamanjaro in a Rhinocerous suit that was set way beyond my interest level. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Gaiman has probably written as good and entertaining a book about Douglas Adams as you could possibly want or expect, but the chapters devoted to projects outside the ones the title led me to expect grind the whole thing down to a screeching halt. This is a book for the truly serious Douglas Adams afficianado; the merely curious should find their entertainment (and their towels) elsewhere.",

        "comment": "Neil Gaiman's Don't Panic succeeds in so far as the author manages to capture the humor of the late Douglas Adams. It lacks depth as a biography but more than blankets the various aspects and versions of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (H2 G2 ) as well as the five book trilogy. It is correctly described in one of the other reviews as the hyperextended bonus feature that was too long to include on any of the CDs or DVD versions of the radio broadcasts, televisions shows and unfortunately the Disney movie.\n\nIf you have come looking for this book and have read this far my assumption is you are a Douglas Adams fan. H2 G2, Dirk Gently or possibly Dr. Who fans constitute the target readership for this book. Granted Douglas Adams had a very slight association with the Monty Python's crew; more of common friendships than creative participation but none of this qualifies Don't Panic for a general audience.\n\nThat portion of the book that is about Douglas Adams is clearly intended as a friends and family type biography. That is, one that is more affectionate than analytical or critical. A very large portion of the discussion of Adams the writer centers around his inability to meet any deadlines which is nothing new for people who know about Adams's history. Daiman does do a decent job of explaining Adamns and missed deadlines by providing the additional context of Adams; too often self-inflicted complex life.\n\nGaiman succeeds as an apologist for Douglas Adams and is someone who can speak in a voice very much like Douglas Adams. I have read as much of Adams published works as are available in America. I own and enjoy the original radio series and the original television series of H2 G2. So I was interested to get to read about the intimate background on most of what occurred in the making of -- to include electronic games and live performances.\n\nMy conclusion is that this is a fan's book. There may be some other audiences such as those who collect biographies of writers or who wish to know more about the creative / production process in any of several media. The ironic /humorous tone makes for easy reading but one can get somewhat bogged down in details.",

        "comment": "Over thirty years ago, a young journalist named Neil Gaiman (you may have heard of him since in other contexts) was given access to Douglas Adams, his life, his files, his unpublished outtakes, and many of his friends and coworkers, to write a highly entertaining account of the creation of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy--the radio show, the six books of the \"trilogy,\" the movie, the games. This is a fascinating look inside how Adams worked, and just how chaotic his creation process was at its best.\n\nBecause yes, all his most creative work was done in at atmosphere of chaos and looming deadlines.\n\nAnd in a time when radio had already become largely a domain of music, news, and talk, he did his best work for radio, and drew in listeners as few if any other entertainment writers and creators could do for radio. This included, of course, not just Hitchhiker's Guide, but his wonderful nature program about endangered species, Last Chance to See.\n\nThis book is its own wild romp, while also giving due attention to Adams's struggles, depression, and frustrations. It's been updated several times since its origial publication, and access to Adams's files provides considerable insight into his working process. The unpublished outtakes and early versions also give us a view of how Hitchhiker's Guide developed, and the happy disregard for continuity and consistency that might have sunk many other creative works, but but gave life and vitality to the Guide in its many forms.\n\nIt's a wonderfully enjoyable and informative book, and I can't really do justice to it. Just read it, okay?\n\nI bought this book.",

        "comment": "Douglass argues the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the superpowers to the brink of a nuclear war, profoundly changed JFK. During the emergency, JFK's hawkish cabinet and Pentagon officials pressured him to attack Cuba. Had he done so, we have since learned, Russian soldiers in Cuba possessed 130 Soviet nuclear-armed missiles with which they could have annihilated the US. Kennedy's restraint in the face of his advisors' hot-headed, maniacal demands for war with the USSR saved the world from a nuclear conflagration.\n\nBut Kennedy's problems with the hawks began before the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the Bay of Pigs. The plan to overthrow the Castro regime had been hatched under the Eisenhower administration. Cuban exiles were assisted by the CIA in a plan that involved sending armed exiles onto the shores of Cuba. The right-wing exiles and their backers in the CIA hoped JFK would be pressured into sending US troops and/or air support for the attack, but JFK refused both. The exile brigade surrendered and more than one thousand were imprisoned in Cuba. Following that episode, an angry JFK said he wanted \"to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.\"\n\nFor his refusal to countenance a nuclear war with the USSR over Cuba, the sociopathic hawks in the Pentagon and CIA saw JFK as \"weak.\" Many in the Cuban exile community in Miami also hated him for failing to provide air support to their illegal invasion. Five months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK delivered a visionary address to the UN, calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons \"before they abolish us...\" This speech could not have thrilled the manufacturers of nuclear weapons nor the hawks in the Pentagon, who were pushing for a nuclear first strike against the USSR.\n\nIn September 1961, JFK and Khrushchev began a back channel correspondence that lasted the remainder of JFK's life. Despite their differences, they came to a mutual understanding of the need for disarmament and détente. The understanding reached via this channel of communication helped save both of them from knuckling under to their more hawkish advisors during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIn November 1961 Kennedy ordered advisors and support units to Vietnam, beginning a steady buildup. Yet six months later he issued National Security Action Memorandum 239, including orders to withdraw all US military personnel from Vietnam by the end of 1963. He had already decided Vietnam was a lost cause; it wasn't our war to fight.\n\nIn April of 1962 he forced the steel industry leaders to rescind price increases that violated a JFK-brokered agreement to fight inflation. When they balked, he canceled Pentagon contracts with the industry, earning him the wrath of the power brokers in the Military Industrial Complex. The next month, he ordered Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to command General Paul Harkins to devise a plan for turning the Vietnam War over to the South Vietnamese and reducing the size of the US military command there.\n\nIt is uncertain when exactly JFK crossed the line--from pissing off the suits in the CIA and Military Industrial Complex, to their decision to kill him. But it might well have happened before the missile crisis. His support of a coalition government in Laos over a more militarized approach didn't help his cause. A turning point may have been reached when JFK ordered a crackdown on the Cuban exile gunboats being run by the CIA out of Miami. The CIA's repeated attempts to entrap the president into launching a US invasion of Cuba, which Douglass documents carefully, had failed yet again.\n\nOf course, JFK was no angel, nor does Douglass present him as such. He made mistakes. Only nine days after his visionary American University address, JFK approved Operation Mongoose, a CIA program of sabotage and harassment against targets in Cuba. This was, as Douglass rightly says, against international law. Douglass suggests Kennedy did this under strain from hawks in his administration demanding increased pressure on Castro to counter Cuba's policy of apparently exporting revolution in Latin America.\n\nOnce we accept that the CIA killed JFK, the point about whether JFK would or would not have pulled out of Vietnam becomes secondary. The CIA killed him--but why? It is wholly implausible that the CIA would kill a president simply to settle a score over his failure to be sufficiently belligerent toward Castro. They would only kill a president if they thought it would make a profound policy difference. And President Kennedy had repeatedly proven himself insufficiently hawkish for the crackpot \"realists\" in the CIA and Pentagon.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1958 Lee Harvey Oswald worked as a radar operator at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan. Here he had a \"crypto\" clearance (higher than \"top secret\") and regularly listened to the U-2 radio communications. Atsugi was the CIA's main operational base in the Far East; many U-2 spy planes departed from this base on their missions over the USSR and China. Oswald, having resigned from the Marines two months earlier, appeared at a US embassy in Moscow in 1959, saying he wanted to renounce his US citizenship and affirming his allegiance to the USSR. He said he would give them all information he had about US radar operations.\n\nWhen the Soviets shot down a U-2 on May 1, 1960, the pilot, the pilot Gary Powers later questioned whether or not his having been shot down might have resulted from information Oswald provided to the Soviets. It was not an unreasonable conjecture, and it underscored the fact that Oswald's giving all the information he had as a Marine radar specialist to the Soviets was a treasonous act, performed at the height of the Cold War.\n\nThis fact is significant, because when Oswald returned to the US Embassy in Moscow a year later, US officials welcomed him back with no questions asked. Not only was he not prosecuted, they gave him a loan to return to the US, and a new passport, 24 hours after he applied. Victor Marchetti, ex-CIA agent and author of the book The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, told Anthony Summers that in 1959 the Office of Naval Intelligence launched a program involving sending approximately three dozen ostensibly disenchanted, poor American youths to the USSR in an attempt find out what communism was all about. Technical eavesdropping was less effective then, and human intelligence was pivotal for intelligence work. Judge James Botelho, Oswald's former roommate in Santa Ana, said Oswald was never a Marxist or Communist. He claimed Oswald's \"defection\" was a US intelligence trick, and that Oswald had been on assignment in Russia for US intelligence.\n\nUpon arriving back from the USSR in 1962, Oswald was met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler's Aid Society, an anti-communist organization with ties to the CIA. With Raikin's help, Oswald, his wife and infant child passed easily through customs and immigration. That summer the Oswalds settled in Fort Worth, Texas. There, George de Mohrenschildt, an oil company consultant and CIA asset, befriended Oswald. De Mohrenschildt admitted in a 1977 interview that he has been given the assignment to meet with Oswald from J. Walton Moore, the Dallas CIA Domestic Contacts Service chief. (47)\n\nDe Mohrenschildt became Oswald's mentor in Dallas, where he helped Oswald secure a new job with a graphic arts company. But De Mohrenschildt likely had little inkling of the convoluted and sinister plot in which he was enmeshed. Years later, in fact, he would express remorse over what had happened to both JFK and Oswald, who were both victims of the same forces.\n\nIn 1963 Oswald moved to New Orleans, where he worked at the Reily Coffee Company, owned by a wealthy supporter of the CIA-sponsored Cuban Revolutionary Council. The company was located near the offices of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service, and Office of Naval Intelligence. Oswald also worked directly across the street from the Naval Intelligence and Secret Service, in the detective agency of former FBI agent Guy Banister. Banister's office was more a covert-action center for US intelligence than a detective agency. It helped supply weapons for CIA covert operations, including the Bay of Pigs and other Cuban-exile attacks on Cuba. Daniel Campbell, an ex-Marine hired by Banister, later admitted that \"Banister was a bagman for the CIA and was running guns to the Alpha 66 (an armed anti-Castro group) in Miami.\" (62)\n\nIt was in New Orleans that Oswald posed as a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, distributing pro-Castro leaflets, apparently intent on drawing attention to himself as a Castro supporter. Oswald would continue to be shepherded and \"mentored\" by various CIA handlers until the assassination of JFK.\n\nIn addition to his documented history as a CIA asset, Oswald was also an FBI informant. Moreover, the evidence suggests that not only was Oswald not a communist, he was a supporter of JFK. Oswald's work with the CIA and the Cuban exiles led him to believe JFK was going to be assassinated. Indeed, there was a plot to kill JFK in Chicago, only twenty days before JFK arrived in Dallas. Douglass cites compelling evidence that it was Oswald himself who tipped off the Chicago police who then arrested the gunmen on the eve of Kennedy's arrival there.\n\nThis book is loaded with creepy details of how this assassination was done: how the autopsy process was taken over by the military; how JFK's cranial x-rays were fraudulently re-made to cover up the documented fact of an entrance wound on his neck and witnesses seeing the back of his skull blown out; how his parade route was changed at the last day, making it more vulnerable to assassins; how fake \"Secret Service\" agents with Secret Service badges thwarted witnesses from pursuing a gunman seen fleeing from the grassy knoll after the shooting; how Jack Ruby was seen by a witness dropping off a gunman in Dealey Plaza at 11 a.m., an hour and a half before the assassination.\n\nTwenty-one out of twenty-two witnesses at Parkland Hospital--most of them doctors and nurses, trained medical observers--agreed in their earliest statements that JFK's massive head wound was located in the right rear of his skull, demonstrating a fatal head shot from the front. They were later pressured by the Warren Commission to recant their statements, making them consistent with the Commission's fabrication of history. Dr. Malcolm Perry repeatedly described a bullet entrance wound in the front of the neck. Yet after being threatened by \"men in suits\" in the Secret Service, he later repudiated his first account as \"inaccurate.\" (308-09)\n\nDouglass's book is not a hagiography of JFK, who was certainly no saint. He was a Cold Warrior; he was a politician. But he was one who, certainly after the Cuban Missile crisis, was turning toward peace and disarmament. And Kennedy was well aware that his moves toward peace--in Indochina as well as with the Soviets, could cost him his life. By the time he went to Dallas, he was certainly aware that he had more to fear from the CIA and hawks in the military industrial complex than he did from the USSR.\n\nThis is a haunting book. It makes it clear that something fundamentally changed with JFK's death. His murder was a coup d'état by the CIA acting on behalf of the military industrial complex. There is extraordinary detail and documentation in this book: it is 410 pages long, with 96 pages of endnotes. Douglass adduces evidence in some cases that did not emerge until after the fall of the Soviet Union, as in the case of the communications between the Kennedy family and the Soviet premier Khrushchev. The correspondence showed that the Kennedy family was well aware that JFK had been killed not by a lone gunman but by \"a right-wing conspiracy.\"\n\nDouglass illustrates how the CIA plot was apparently designed to portray the assassin as a pro-Castro agent, to justify a retaliatory invasion of Cuba and possible nuclear strike against the USSR. But the evidence emerging after the murder revealed too many \"Oswalds\" in too many different places at the same time for that story to be credible. Moreover, it would have been impossible for Oswald to have killed JFK from where he was alleged to have done so.\n\nPresident Johnson faced three choices in response to the assassination: (1) Take what was obviously bogus evidence of a Castro-Soviet connection to the murder and use it to justify an invasion of Cuba and possible hot war against the Soviets; (2) confront the CIA on its falsified documents of Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in the months prior to November 1963, and face a domestic war with the CIA in which it would fight with every covert weapon at its command; or (3) participate in a cover-up of any conspiracy evidence \"and a silent coup d'état that would reverse Kennedy's efforts to end the Cold War. He chose to cover up everything and surrender to Cold War prerogatives.\" (81)\n\nThe FBI is revealed to have been implicated in the cover-up surrounding JFK's assassination, as was the Dallas Police department. What is amazing is how the CIA had so much power to pull this off, but after reading Douglass' careful, meticulous review of the evidence, one has little room to doubt it.\n\nI keep returning to the \"unspeakable\" in the title, and \"why it matters.\" \"Unspeakable\" is a perfect word, because it connotes evil--\"unspeakable evil\"--and at the same time denotes what is forbidden or taboo. It is axiomatic within enlightened circles that there is evil at the heart of the United States. We saw it during the Civil Rights movement in the south, in the lynchings, the cross burnings. We saw it in the Vietnam War. And we saw it in the murder of JFK, certainly. But with the other evils, it was easier to place the locus of responsibility onto an Other. The problem was the southern racists, or the KKK, or the war criminals in the White House. Douglass makes clear, however, that the foe we face is much more formidable foe: it is ourselves, and our denial.\n\nWhat does Douglass mean by the \"unspeakable\"? He means not only those men and institutions who killed JFK, those who dedicate their lives to promoting war and killing over peace and cooperation. Thomas Merton used the term \"unspeakable\" after the murders of JFK, MLK and Robert Kennedy in the 60s, for \"an evil whose depth and deceit...go beyond the capacity of words to describe.\" We might go so far as to say the unspeakable is the existence in the heart of the power structure of the US government, of a Mafia. Indeed, the CIA had an ongoing working relationship with the Mafia at the time of JFK's killing.\n\nRather than define the unspeakable too narrowly, Douglass leaves us with some profound questions: \"What does the nature of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy reveal about ourselves? What does it reveal about a national security state we have allowed to assume control over our lives? Have we reached the point where the state itself has become an enemy of the people, at least until we the people can manage to change, even revolutionize, its purpose? Can we transform our lives, and the state of the United States of America, so as to practice the truth that waging peace is our only real security?\" (374)",

        "comment": "I had just turned 13 the month before the startling news was broadcast into my 8th grade classroom: President John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas and had been rushed to the hospital. It was followed by the bulletin that the President was dead. Lorenzo, my fellow classmate, an Italian Catholic, burst into tears. I sat quietly thinking: at least we got that Papist out of the White House! The anti-Catholic indoctrination I received from my church and parents never allowed me to see JFK as a person, only a symbol of a false religion to reject. Oh, and he was a Democrat as well!\n\nHad I known the JFK that Jim Douglass reveals in his new book, I would have had more reasons to dismiss him: a President engaging in peacemaking activities with the Premier of the godless Communists, Nikita Khrushchev, passing letters back and forth that even members of his Cabinet were unaware! A US President secretly arranging for face-to-face consultations with Fidel Castro to resume normal diplomatic relations with a communist Cuba! The man who issued the secret National Security Action Memorandum 263 ordering the removal of 1,000 US Military advisors from Vietnam by the end of 1963 and ALL US Troops by the end of 1965. Under the guise of \"peacemaking\" President John F. Kennedy was urging \"capitulation\" to the Soviets in the Cold War - at least from my junior high school analysis.\n\nJim Douglass describes JFK's \"turning\" - his movement toward peace rather than \"victory\" after the almost catastrophic \"Cuban Missile Crisis\" the year before in 1962. While the world was on the brink of nuclear devastation, I had practiced the \"duck and cover\" technique at school in the event the Ruskies dropped \"the big one\". My own personal \"turning\" toward peace began five years later when I had to register for the military draft when I turned 18 in the fall of 1968. Fortunately I was no longer dependent on getting political perspective from US News and World Report (The Commies are killing our missionaries in Vietnam!) nor my theology from my evangelical/fundamentalist church (Jesus' call to \"Love your enemies\" was trumped by St. Paul's admonition to the Christians in Rome: \"Let every soul obey the governing authorities\").\n\nHaving been issued a uniform and rifle for the compulsory ROTC class when I registered for my college freshman year, I had an epiphany on the rifle range when I realized that even though the targets were circular, they were, in reality, the bodies of the \"Viet Cong\". Under no reading of Jesus' teaching could I justify pulling the trigger so I registered as a conscientious objector. I had begun my own turning. Little did I know that one year later, I would be marching on the local Wheaton, IL draft board arm-in-arm with a Catholic priest! Another year later would find me taking some courses with that priest at the nearby Catholic Maryknoll Seminary. Soon I would discover Jim Douglass' The Non-Violent Cross after I had left behind my anti-Catholic upbringing and was open to hearing the \"Gospel\" through a new lens. My own turning toward peace.\n\nWhy would a legendary peace theologian get caught up in conspiracy theory? That was my first question when I received an invitation to attend a Pax Christi retreat 5 or 6 years ago led by Jim Douglass. I'd read virtually all his excellent books, followed his campaign against the Trident and the White Train delivering nuclear weapons to those submarines, and had met him at several conferences on peacemaking. When he and his wife Shelly moved to Birmingham to form a Catholic Worker House, I anticipated seeing more of him because I was only four or five hours away in southwest Georgia. However, soon after they arrived, our family moved to Minnesota. Now here was a chance to re-connect with this insightful theologian-activist. But his retreat topic was on the connections between the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers, Martin King and Malcolm X! He talked about how American deals with its prophets - in similar fashion to the way the Romans dealt with the notorious Galilean troublemaker during the administration of Pilate and Felix. At the time, Jim was only beginning the long research project that has led to this first of what promises to be a trilogy of books on the killings of prophets and peacemakers in the 60s in America.\n\nResearch indeed! JFK and the Unspeakable has close to 100 pages of small-print footnotes to document and explain his sources about the JFK most of us did not know. However, a small but powerful force within the government, namely the CIA, the FBI, the Joint Chiefs of the military, and even some of his own Cabinet and advisors, came to feel the need to remove him as a danger to an American strategy of global domination. Kennedy, recognizing that the use of nuclear weapons against the Soviets would leave an estimated 140 million dead, decided you could not \"win\" the Cold War. The others in that military-industrial-intelligence complex felt that with \"only\" a few million Americans killed if America struck with a first-strike, we could \"win\". The window for such an advantage in the nuclear arsenal and delivery systems would narrow and begin to close after 1964, leading some to conclude that the obstacle that the President embodied would have to be removed before the end of 1963.\n\nThe \"unspeakable\" in the title comes from Trappist monk/peacemaker Thomas Merton's book, Raids on the Unspeakable. It is a term he used to describe the confluence of evil within systems like governments, corporations, and other power centers. Walter Wink uses the term \"the Domination System\". St. Paul referred to \"the Principalities and Powers\". President Eisenhower coined the phrase \"the Military Industrial Complex\". Catholic Worker Dorothy Day talked about \"this filthy, rotten system. The \"unspeakable\" that conspired (breathed together) against JFK (and later his brother as well) was the manifestation of the national security state that insisted on total allegiance to both its ideology and methodology. Kennedy ran for office as a Cold Warrior. Only his glimpse into the abyss that was the Cuban Missile Crisis allowed him to see how close that system pushed toward a nuclear holocaust.\n\nKennedy was truly saved by his enemy - Nikita Khrushchev. The irony this book discloses that all three antagonists, Castro, Kennedy, and Khrushchev, all had struggled for peaceful co-existence in opposition to their own advisors. Each leader was trapped within national systems that had a vested interest in keeping the conflict going rather than risking a negotiated resolution.\n\nThrough extensive interviews and research, Douglass paints a compelling portrait of the supposed assassin/\"patsy\", Lee Harvey Oswald. While the Warren Commission (conveniently controlled by ex-CIA Chief, Allen Dulles) failed to interview numerous witnesses that might challenge the \"lone gunman\" theory, Douglass sought out the stories that convincingly (to me) argued for at least one or more \"Oswald\" doubles. Douglass argues that the CIA hoped to pin blame for the assassination of the US President on both Cuba and the Soviets, urging the new President, Lyndon Johnson to \"retaliate\" with their desired preemptive nuclear strike.\n\nIt was the successful cover-up orchestrated by the Warren Commission Report that led to the subsequent assassinations of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, followed by Kennedy's brother, Bobby is the argument Douglass puts forth. JFK and the Unspeakable is the first of a trilogy of books attempting to unmask or at least begin to demystify this force of evil that has so captivated our national soul.\n\nBesides attempting to portray John Kennedy's courage in his \"turning\", Douglass also wants to steel his readers who are committed to peacemaking to be realistic about the challenges we face. If the \"unspeakable\" is willing to kill a sitting President, what should we expect if we attempt to follow Jesus down that same road? The Kennedy that Douglass portrays is less overtly religious than Martin King in his last days (\"I only want to do God's will.\"). JFK \"looked into the abyss\" and chose his path of change or turning when he decided that the fate of the world's children were at stake if these nukes were ever used again. Kennedy realized that even just the atmospheric testing of these weapons imperiled the health of all humanity with the radioactive fallout.\n\nBut Kennedy's religious tradition also spoke to him clearly - especially through the powerful words of the initiator of Vatican II, Pope John XXIII with his final masterpiece, Pacem in Terris. The impact of this work so moved Nikita Khrushchev that he is reported to have kept a medallion given to him by this beloved pontiff on his desk in the Kremlin as a way to irritate some of his own Politburo advisors. Kennedy's own commencement speech given at American University five months before his death certainly owed some of its power and insight to the recently deceased pope who died two weeks prior to that June 1963 address. In that speech which ironically was carried more widely over the radio to Soviet citizens (and ignored by most US media), Kennedy cautioned Americans not to demonize the other side. His words, \"... not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats. No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue.\", could (and should) be readily applied today to Ahmadinejad's Iran.\n\nThe book also raises a very disturbing portrait of how this National Security State imperils our democracy. The idea of a group of secretive men (although there are probably some women in the mix today) deciding who can be or remain President exposes the figure-head nature of the power of that office. The collusion of un-elected agents, military officers, wealthy business elites, \"diplomats\" and others plotting behind the scenes to replace the elected head-of-state is not just something that happens in Third World nations. Was what happened in November 1963 in Dallas really a coup-d'etat?\n\nBack in the mid-70s, William Stringfellow raised questions about the compatibility between democracy and the apparatus of a National Security State. Stringfellow, drawing on the insights of Biblical prophets and the writings of Jewish theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel, called the allegiance demanded of citizens by this obsession with \"security\" during the Cold War by its Biblical name: idolatry. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire, cold warriors searched about for new adversaries so they could continue to justify our dependence on and subservience to the military industrial complex out of fear. Terrorism conveniently became the new whipping boy and the anticipated \"peace dividend\" disappeared.\n\nWhile Douglass' JFK story harkens back to the Cold War, the idolatry of the National Security State is as strong as ever - and its practitioners stand ready to remove or marginalize any who stand in its way. How else could one explain the almost universal condemnation of former-President Jimmy Carter's sit-down with the leadership of Hamas and Syria this Spring? Or the annual rite of genuflecting before the power of AIPAC by both Democrats and Republicans - each vying to out-do the other in pandering to the Israeli state, ignoring and neglecting the cries for justice emanating from behind the 26' tall \"security barrier\", the new Berlin Wall that Carter has identified as apartheid?\n\nThis book is sobering, disturbing -but ultimately hopeful as well. If even such a stout Cold Warrior as John Fitzgerald Kennedy could decide to \"turn toward peace\" -albeit at a terrible price - can we too break the shackles of fear and greed and begin that same turning ourselves? As Jim Douglass reminded a friend of mine: who is the real \"hero\", the prime mover of this story? It is God - God working through JFK, Khrushchev, and others who had the courage to take risks for peace. \"After all,\" Douglass reminded him, \"the nuclear holocaust didn't happen!\"\n\nWe must open ourselves to recognize the common humanity we share, as \"we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's futures. And we are all mortal.\" When we recognize and act on this, we join hands with the Creator and work together to build a world of peace. One place to start is exposing, unmasking, naming the truth behind this system. Exposing it to the light. It might put us in its target but only by escaping its clutches can we truly be free and healed of that primal urge to dominate.",

A cop... and the criminal he was shackled to (Washington Post).\n\nOn an icy night in October 1984, a commuter plane carrying nine passengers crashed in the remote wilderness of northern Alberta, killing six people. Four survived: the rookie pilot, a prominent politician, a cop, and the criminal he was escorting to face charges. Despite the poor weather, Erik Vogel, the 24-year-old pilot, was under intense pressure to fly. Larry Shaben, the author's father and Canada's first Muslim Cabinet Minister, was commuting home after a busy week at the Alberta Legislature. Constable Scott Deschamps was escorting Paul Archambault, a drifter wanted on an outstanding warrant. Against regulations, Archambault's handcuffs were removed-a decision that would profoundly impact the men's survival.\n\nAs the men fight through the night to stay alive, the dividing lines of power, wealth, and status are erased, and each man is forced to confront the precious and limited nature of his existence.",

    "synopsis": "The gripping account of how the Royal family really operates, from the journalist who has spent years studying them. Who really runs the show and, as Charles III begins his reign, what will happen next?\n\nThroughout history, the British monarchy has relied on its courtiers - the trusted advisers in the King or Queen's inner circle - to ensure its survival as a family and a pillar of the country. Today, as ever, a carefully selected team of people hidden from view steers the royal family's path between public duty and private life. Queen Elizabeth II, after a remarkable 70 years of service, saw the final seasons of her reign without her husband Philip to guide her. Now, a newly ascended Charles seeks to define what his future as King, and that of his court, will be.\n\nThe question of who is entrusted to guide the royals has never been more vital. Yet, as the tensions within the family are exposed to global scrutiny like never before, the task these courtiers face has never been more challenging. With a dark cloud hanging over Prince Andrew as well as Harry and Meghan's controversial departure from royal life, William and Kate - equipped with a very 21st century approach to press and public relations - now hold the responsibility of making an ancient institution relevant for the decades to come. In fascinating and explosive detail, Valentine Low explores the previously unknown relationship between modern courtiers and the royal family.\n\nCourtiers pulls back the veil to reveal an ever-changing system of complex characters, shifting alliances, and a battle of ideas over what the future of the institution should be. This is the inside story of how the monarchy really works, at a pivotal moment in its history.",

Valentine Low, British journalist and royal correspondent for The Times, has done an even-handed, carefully researched, concrete and corroborated presentation of the facts surrounding the Sussexes, their aides, and the unfolding of Megxit.\n\nI do chide myself for having nearly taken random reader reviews as gospel. But truly, there are any number floating about the internet (Amazon, Goodreads, Book Riot, Library Thing, etc) describing the book as mainly a history of courtiers and their roles in the lives of monarchs from the time of Elizabeth I to Elizabeth II, with only a passing mention of the current principals. That is simply not true.\nLow does provide a healthy (and enjoyable) overview of courtiers past and present, an overview that gives the reader a sense of the sort of person who becomes a courtier: serious, self-controlled, earnest, loyal, well-educated, discreet, pragmatic, devoted to the institution of the monarchy, socially adept, logical, responsible, emotionally stable, politic, judicious, understated, and impeccably polite. If there is room for criticism of the nature of the courtier past and present, and Low allows there may well be, it is the sameness of background that favors such qualities: Eton, Oxford, Cambridge, educations, distinguished military careers, well-born privilege, and the ease of navigating the rarified atmosphere of the British upper classes, that goes with that. This general introduction to the role of courier, along with the subsequent telling of roles specific couriers have played in the lives of specific principals, is the backdrop against which Low reports the words, and actions, attitudes and reactions of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, The Duke of Edinburg, Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Edward VII, Charles, Diana, the Parker-Bowles woman, the Yorks, the Wales’, and yes, the Sussexes…three chapters worth of Sussex antics. The reader is left to draw his own conclusions about each courtier and each principal.\n\nI do wonder what’s with the reviews that essentially say “Move on. Nothing to see here. Why, ‘H.’ and ‘M.’ get barely a footnote. Just a fusty old history lesson about some fusty old men in grey suits.”\n\nI Say, Don’t believe them. Not in a Megxit Minute.

        "comment": "First, the cover of “Courtiers” by the [London] Times columnist, Valentine Low is misleading. The Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex play minor roles so, apart from advertising, I don’t know why they are so prominently featured.\nSecond, the book itself is a fascinating look at the all-important behind-the-scenes attendants to the principals in the British constitutional monarchy. Mr. Low covers in detail the courtiers who advised HM Queen Elizabeth II throughout her 70-year reign as well as those in similar positions in the households of the then Prince of Wales (now King Charles III) and the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (now Prince and Princess of Wales) and Prince Harry before and after his marriage to Meghan Markle.\nThere are some delicious “gossipy” bits, but the bulk of the narrative is focused on those people who operate behind the scenes and describe well how they make “the trains run on time”. I agree with another reviewer that it would be helpful to have a chart of who’s who, since most of them would be unfamiliar to a reader who only knows about the famous faces.",

    "synopsis": "The award-winning true-crime account of a Danish nurse accused of killing her patients—now a Netflix miniseries starring Josephine Park.\n\nIn the early hours of March 1, 2015, Danish police received an alarming call from a nurse at a provincial hospital. She suspected her colleague, fellow nurse Christina Aistrup Hansen, of deliberately killing patients—and she feared it had just happened again. Soon, other coworkers revealed their own concerns about Hansen. Indeed, some had been harboring suspicions about her for years . . .\n\nSo why had no one come forward sooner? And with the alleged victims already cremated, where was the evidence? Could this all be a case of small-town gossip snowballing out of control? Drawing on police and autopsy reports, medical records, private correspondence, and testimony from key witnesses—as well as Hansen herself—Danish journalist Kristian Corfixen reconstructs the fateful night shift in which three patients died under mysterious circumstances, and the sensational trial it set in motion.\n\nOriginally published in Denmark, Corfixen’s acclaimed investigation of a disturbingly complex case raises critical concerns about the trust we put in our caretakers, and the role of indicative evidence in criminal courts.",

        "comment": "Medical Ward M130 treats the hospital’s most seriously ill patients. On that ward, Cristina Aistrup Hansen is the lead nurse. Cristina gained a reputation as a take charge person and was often portrayed as the Nurse Nightingale of that floor. However, statistics would prove othewise.\n\nIn 2010, Cristina would complete her first year working in Ward M130. That year, 87 patients were declared dead. An unusually high number. In 2011, a startling 95 patients were declared dead. As the death toll climbed, Cristina’s colleagues became increasingly wary of the sinister statistics, which lead to Cristina being accused of poisoning her patients in 2012.\n\nThough only three deaths and an attempted murder were linked to Cristina, speculation was that there were dozens more. But there wasn’t enough evidence to link the dozens of more deaths to Cristina. Even the four that were linked were circumstantial. But with the evidence on hand, Cristina was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of three people and the attempted murder on one person.\n\nCristina appealed and based on updated evidence, Cristina’s sentence got reduced to 12 years with credit for time served. Cristina is slated for parole in March 2023.\n\nThe Nurse is a mild true crime novel as it doesn’t contain a lot of gory details. There’s a lot of facts and figures that can get overwhelming, but I found it interesting. Some of the terminology can be a speed bump in the reading flow, but there are footnotes and references to help along the way.\n\nI enjoyed the bulk of the novel and found Corfixen’s details highly interesting. Added to her details is the fact that Corfixen manages to include the updates on Cristina’s appeal and parole status. What didn’t appeal to me is the tangential narrative about Health Care Serial Killers. It didn’t add much and I just found it a distraction to the true crime story at hand.\n\nOverall, The Nurse is an engaging read if you enjoy the true crime genre. It would be interesting to learn what other true crime novels Corfixen has in store for us. Four stars.\n\nI received a digital copy of the book from Podium Publishing through NetGalley. The review herein is completely my own and contains my honest thoughts and opinions.",

With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food.\n\nAs she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.\n\nVivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.",

The search for family identity with food is so very poinient and familiar. Do I want, like, or desire fried potatoes or liver with onions? Doesn't matter, my mother did and to keep that memory of her, it happens. Thank you Michelle for being the rebellious surviving mama's girl.

Zauner voices it herself and you can hear the emotion in her retelling so well, and it's a huge bonus to hear the Korean pronunciation if you're not Korean yourself. Overall I thought this book was very real, and showed all of the lovely parts of her relationship with her mother and the pain alongside it. I loved the food motif throughout the book and think many people will find it relatable. I love Korean food, but for a few people this was their first introduction to the cuisine and culture, and it got them to try Korean food for the first time. This book will probably make you cry!!\n\nThe only critique I had of it was I thought it was a little too unstructured. I listened to it with my partner and they found the first opening chapters hard to get into since Zauner starts off with a very wide view of her story/relationship with her mother/her feelings. Once she gets into the chronological-ish parts you get totally roped in. Don't expect a \"satisfying\" ending, because there is no \"close\" to her story. Her life is obviously ongoing and there are still feelings she's grappling with. It would be impossible to wrap up neatly!\n\nLoved it!!",

Within pages of starting this book I started seeing similarities between Michelle's Umma and my own mother in law. Things I thought were arbitrary and off the wall things that she will tell me are actually 100% Korean cultural things that she does. I am blown away at the amount of insight into Korean culture, that I previously only had from one point of view. This book had me crying from start to finish. It's beautifully written. Throughout the book I would stop and ask my partner what certain things were (some he knew, some he didn't), and with some I got an anecdote from his childhood about how his Halmoni would make him certain foods. I feel more connected to, not only my partner through this book, but also my in laws. Absolutely recommend if you are interested in learning about Korean culture, don't mind crying, and overall want to read a really good book!",

        "comment": "Barbara Taylor is an excellent writer and storyteller, and this autobiographical book is a compelling read. In this book, she writes about her own journey in faith and a life-changing decision: After twenty years of ordained ministry in a church position, Taylor resigned as rector of a relatively small Episcopal church in the North Georgia mountains to accept a position teaching religion at a small college nearby.\n\nThe title \"Leaving Church\" is inaccurate, of course, because leaving ordained parish ministry is not the same as leaving church. Taylor is still an Episcopal priest, but even if she had resigned as a priest, she would still not necessarily have left church. The title stems from Taylor's resignation as a church rector, which surprised many people, and some apparently misunderstood her choice as really leaving church and/or losing her faith. In this book, Taylor explains the journey that led to her change in direction, providing an overview of her experience of ordained ministry and her transition out of church employment. Overall, she regards the decision to leave as spiritually liberating.\n\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, Taylor says too little about the actual decision to leave, other than emphasizing that she was tired and depressed. Although Taylor emphasized how hard she worked, so much so that it's almost exhausting to read about it, her decision to resign as rector of a church never seems adequately explained. From the viewpoint of many -- particularly those engaged in ordained ministry -- she has lived a charmed and even enviable life. First, after an apparently easy ordination process, she immediately received a position at a large and wealthy multi-staff church in central Atlanta, working with a popular rector. Then she was called as a rector of a charming church in exactly the area she and her husband wanted to live - the kind of location that people retire to because it's so beautiful. Taylor appears to have been financially comfortable throughout her ministry, and the couple were able to build a dream house on 100 beautiful acres in the mountains (with three streams on their property!) In the meantime, she was developing a widespread reputation as an outstanding preacher while authoring a number of popular books. What's not to like about this life? Sounds ideal, right?\n\nApparently the author didn't like it, or at least the part about being rector of a parish, because she resigned. Exhaustion and symptoms of depression appear to have played a major role, as well as conflict in a church split over the issue of homosexuality. However, little time is spent discussing the decision to resign and even less on the reaction of the church members. Some of this may have been unavoidable, because of concerns about confidentiality and washing dirty linen in public. Taylor mentions that she had committed to stay 10 years when she accepted the position and left after 5 1/2, but other than that, says little about breaking that agreement. Additionally, she mentions only in passing that her recently hired assistant had to resign when she did (it's the rule). She hints that some in the church were unhappy with her (perhaps because she was spread too thin?) Certainly, one wonders about the wisdom of her initial commitment: 10 years is a long time to commit to. I wish she had felt free to tell more about that part of her story and spent less time describing finding God in the beauty of nature. I get it. Nature is lovely. The mountains are lovely - it's easier to find God there than in a church hall of angry people. Life in the church can be as messy as any barnyard, and that no doubt contributed to her decision, but she barely mentioned it. It was frustrating when she skipped quickly over her farewell party but spent pages on birds.\n\nIt seems likely, also, that much of the author's exhaustion came from her own very high standards and successful outside endeavors. Taylor barely mentions her increasingly busy schedule filled with engagements outside her own church, as her reputation as preacher and author grew. She was no doubt traveling frequently while living in a remote area, accessible only by mountain roads. Additionally, Taylor's many publications during this period would by itself be sufficient work for most people! She says virtually nothing about these activities but instead describes the demands of providing pastoral care. It's amazing she managed to do all that she did for as long as she did without completely burning out.\n\nThis book would be great for use by a book club, particularly those in a church setting, as it raises some provocative questions. I wonder if the author will find that even after \"leaving church,\" she will continue to find herself over-scheduled, with more demands on her than most people could manage. I hope not, because she's definitely gifted as both an author and preacher.",

        "comment": "The author was an Episcopalian Priest who walked away from a very strong identity to her church and it rattled her to the foundations of her faith. Anyone who has left a church, regardless of the religion, can relate to the universal truth about feeling betrayed and dislocated without something so pivotal as to how we connect with God.\n\nLike so many of us who bring our idealistic notions into church with high expectations of both serving God and experiencing God, a popped church balloon can send us plummeting to the ground. The ground is very hard and for many of us we end up splattered everywhere and it takes a long time to put Humpty Dumpty back together again--and then we're not the same--what with those cracks all over!\n\nWhen I left my church, I had no idea that others had left. I had know idea that Christians had similar \"exit\" experiences of betrayal, hurt and grief when leaving their churches. The damages done when leaving a church does not seem to be about religion, but more about leaving a conviction in God. We feel betrayed by God. We question how it was even possible to be led down this path? Is it God's fault? Is it our fault?\n\nFor the author, she literally had to decide what to do the day \"after\" she left her clergy position with her church, whereas for some the realization they've left might take a long time.\n\nBarbara Brown Taylor went through actual physical withdrawals, finding herself on the floor with horrible headaches. It seemed she started pulling herself together by remembering the Sabbath and making time for a personal relationship with God, rather than all the doing for everyone else. Her healing came through nature and by opening her mind to other religions, weighing them against her own, and finding peace somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe author found it hard to go to other churches, and her the transition from leader to follower was unsettling. For me, just attending a Christian church felt like betrayal on the highest order! I'd jumped off the jet and onto the bullcart! Oh what we can do to our spiritual lives.\n\nLike the author, I couldn't find spiritual or emotional support. Local Christian Pastors had no experience to counsel me, and for Barbara she'd been the counselor!\n\nOur differences part here, as Barbara went off looking for the meaning behind other religions and embraced them, while I had been down those \"many roads,\" and had settled onto the Road to Damascus.\n\nShe wrote a moving story of her father's decline and death from cancer, another subject that I'm very familiar with, and she made this astute observation while watching him die and wondering about his relationship with God: \"All I found out was how helpless love can be, with nothing left to do but suffer alongside with the beloved.\"\n\nI highly recommend this book to affirm that the loss of a church can be devastating but the return to spiritual health entirely possible.",

A distressed housewife, Stella Nickell, said her husband Bruce was having a seizure. Officers rushed to the Nickell’s mobile home, to find Stella standing frozen at the door… Bruce was on the floor fighting for his life.\n\nAs Stella became the beneficiary of over $175,000 in a life insurance pay-out, forensics discovered that Bruce had consumed painkillers laced with cyanide.\n\nA week later, fifteen-year-old Hayley was getting ready for another school day. Her mom, Sue, called out ‘I love you’ before heading into the bathroom and moments later collapsed on the floor.

    "synopsis": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Passionate advocate for end-of-life care and TikTok star Hadley Vlahos shares moving stories of joy, wisdom, and redemption from her patients’ final moments in this “brilliant” (Zibby Owens, Good Morning America) memoir.\n \n“This extraordinary book helps dispel fear around death and dying—revealing it to be a natural part of our soul’s evolution.”—Laura Lynne Jackson, New York Times bestselling author of Signs and The Light Between Us\n\nTalking about death and dying is considered taboo in polite company, and even in the medical field. Our ideas about dying are confusing at best: Will our memories flash before our eyes? Regrets consume our thoughts? Does a bright light appear at the end of a tunnel? For most people, it will be a slower process, one eased with preparedness, good humor, and a bit of faith. At the forefront of changing attitudes around palliative care is hospice nurse Hadley Vlahos, who shows that end-of-life care can teach us just as much about how to live as it does about how we die.\n \nVlahos was raised in a strict religious household, but began questioning her beliefs in high school after the sudden death of a friend. When she got pregnant at nineteen, she was shunned by her community and enrolled herself in nursing school to be able to support herself and her baby. But nursing soon became more than a job: when she focused on palliative care and hospice work, it became a calling. \n \nIn The In-Between, Vlahos recounts the most impactful experiences she’s had with the people she’s worked with—from the woman who never once questioned her faith until she was close to death, to the older man seeing visions of his late daughter, to the young patient who laments that she spent too much of her short life worrying about what others thought of her—while also sharing her own fascinating journey.\n \nWritten with profound insight, humility, and respect, The In-Between is a heartrending memoir that shows how caring for others can transform a life while also offering wisdom and comfort for those dealing with loss and providing inspiration for how to live now.",

        "comment": "July 28th 2023 marks a full year that my Great-Grandma had passed. Only she felt way more like a (second) mother. I had found Nurse Hadley- a Hospice nurse on TikTok prior to my Grandmas decline. It sparked my interest in learning more about Hospice but not enough. I hated thinking about Hospice and it was my least favorite thing to hear when a loved one was placed under their care. It made my heart cringe. Instant tears when Hospice was mentioned because it meant the time was ticking. My Grandma was placed under Hospice Palliative Care at the end of June. My biggest fear was coming true and I had to remain calm for my family, especially my Grandma. I wanted to spend every second with her that I could. I lived an hour away with my now husband and we shared one car and I was only bringing home $85 a week from a sandwich shop.. I would bring my then fiancé to work, sometimes a half hour from our apartment making the drive to Grandma an hour and a half long. I told my boss at the sub shop that I would need to stop working for the foreseeable future until everything was said and done. I knew I needed to soak in every. Little. Thing. So I drove an hour to an hour and a half every single day with the exception of one day. I would need to be back to pick up my fiancé by the end of his 8 hour shifts sometimes 10 and sometimes 12. No matter the amount of time that day, I spent it with Grandma. Things declined rapidly. I was feeding her ice cream sandwiches and giving her water one day. The next she couldn’t wake up or form coherent sentences. I ended up staying one evening at my Grandparents house in a camper in the yard. I told my fiancé I needed him to take the next day off. I couldn’t leave. We packed up and stayed in my parents RV at my Mimi & Papa’s house (where Grandma had been staying). We sat with her almost lifeless body and shared fond memories of our lives with her. We each took turns sitting in the chair next to her, holding her hand, kissing her head, and reminding her how loved she was. As the night went on she started this awful groaning and yelling. I was worried she was in pain and couldn’t stand to see her like that. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening or how we could help. My mom was once a hospice nurse and she told me it was okay. She was just having a family reunion with our passed on loved ones. I thought my mom had only told me this for comfort. My mom is a good mom and even at 23 often still protects my child-like heart. I accepted this as it gave me comfort to think like that but wasn’t totally sure I believed it. The next morning at 6:50 AM my Grandma passed away peacefully holding her sons hand. We got the phone call in the RV and all rushed in to say our goodbyes. My best friend was gone. In a way I felt like I was relieved because she wasn’t in pain anymore. She lived a long life (91 years) and passed away surrounded by some of the people who cared most about her. The hospice nurse came about an hour later and did the usual protocol. Listened to the heart for 2 minutes and called out the time of death. Later the kind nurse was comforting us and asked if I had any questions. I had mentioned the groaning the night before and asked if she was in pain. The nurse replied “oh no honey! She was definitely talking up a storm with your other loved ones who have passed on. Happens all the time!” I was shocked but again sort of assumed because I was young they were just trying to protect my feelings. They had previously left a booklet about the signs to look for when your loved one is dying. I took it and it sparked my interest. I read it and was always curios to know more. When I recently heard Nurse Hadley had a book about “The In-Between” I begged my husband to get it. I downloaded it to my Kindle and got to reading! I finished it July 27, 2023.. one night before the one year anniversary or my Grandmas passing. I found so much comfort and joy in reading nurse Hadley and her patients stories knowing my Grandma had a similar story to some of her patients. It made me feel so at peace that my grandma had such a peaceful passing. That she was seeing her parents, her siblings, her son Rickey. I know it was a reunion she waited many many years for. I felt at peace knowing that night she really wasn’t in pain. She was catching up with old friends in the in between and resting her soul in the real world for her big trip with them. “The In Between” was beautifully written by a wonderful nurse whom I’ve never met but reminded me a lot of my momma. A single mom of one child at a young age persuing a nursing career. This book has healed a little of my broken heart and I am grateful. ❤️",

        "comment": "In her remarkable book, Nurse Hadley takes readers on an emotional rollercoaster, sharing her experiences as a new nurse (and as a single mother dating Chris) to an experienced nurse alongside the poignant stories of her patients. With an engaging and personable writing style, she effortlessly draws readers into the world of life, death, and patients' profound impact on her life.\n\nEach chapter of this book introduces a new patient (including her boyfriend's mom) and their unique story, allowing us to witness firsthand how people live and the process of how they die. Through these stories, Hadley skillfully offers profound life lessons that transcend the boundaries of the medical field, leaving readers with a wealth of insight into the human psyche and our relationship with mortality.\n\nWhat sets this book apart is Hadley's ability to blend her narratives with the significance gleaned from her patients' journeys.

Whether you find yourself laughing, shedding tears, feeling awe-struck, or pausing to re-read passages, you'll quickly realize that Nurse Hadley's words have a transformative power beyond the pages. Nurse Hadley teaches the reader through storytelling as her patients teach her their life lessons.\n\nAs a gifted writer, nurse, and YouTuber, Hadley captivates readers by challenging societal views on death. By sharing her experiences and the wisdom gained from her patients, she encourages readers to reflect on their beliefs and confront the inevitable reality of our mortality. Through storytelling, she gently guides us toward a greater understanding of death and helps us prepare for its profound impact on our lives and those we love.\n\nNurse Hadley's book is a must-read for everyone. Whether you have personally experienced loss or are simply curious about the human experience of dying, this book will touch your heart and leave an indelible mark on your soul. It serves as a compass, guiding us through the uncharted waters of death and revealing answers we may not have known we were searching for.

With its engaging storytelling and her wisdom from experience and skills, this book is a testament to the power of human connection and the importance of embracing life's final journey.\n\nI did not want this book to end.\nPlease write more, Nurse Hadley.\nPictures: 1: Hardcover front, 2 &3: Conclusion pages, and 4: Excellent tone in writing, 5: Rawness of Hadley's style.",

        "comment": "Many people shy away from the topics of terminal illness and death. This is definitely not true of Hadley Vlahos, R.N.!! Nurse Hadley has taken a topic that at one time was taboo and which is still, in 2023, often avoided. This book sheds light not only on final illness and death, it also touches on many other topics, as Nurse Hadley weaves her personal story throughout her Autobiography.\nThe reader is told of childhood trauma, unplanned pregnancy, single motherhood, changes in one’s life dreams, decision on a course of education and devoting oneself to study and learning, choice of a career of caring for others, finding true love in an unexpected way and place, empathy for patients and their family members, and the spirituality surrounding the end of life.\nThroughout this book is the overlay of LOVE. Love on many levels. Nurse Hadley has managed to inform the reader about aspects of the end of life in a way that is filled with love, light, release, joy and spirituality.\nI highly recommend this easily read book, which I will read again and again. I’ve already begun gifting this book to family members and friends.\nI so hope this is not Hadley Vlahos, R.N.’s first and only published work, as I want to read more, many more, future books penned by her.",

Many scenes are absolutely hilarious, I laughed out loud often. With its quick pace it is almost impossible to put down.\n\nThe style holds your interest as the author juxtaposes this family trip with adventures of his own travels 20 years earlier as a single college graduate. He reflects on the intense strain but also the immense joy which comes from sharing his love of camping with his family. I found it to be insightful and moving.\n\n“Tent” does what we hope all good books will do: transport us from our day to day lives to fun and excitement without leaving our easy chairs. But it goes further. It invites the readers to reflect on their own adventures and their handling of adversity while recognizing the importance of family and friends in their own lives.\n\nAnd it specially reminds us to acknowledge the kindness of strangers. Perhaps if we reflect carefully, we too might realize we’ve crossed paths with an “angel” or two in our own lives.",

And yet, she would go back to her Mom in a second if she would have her.\nMakes me wonder if she has some if her Moms mental problems , herself, If she has inherited some of her Moms narcissism.",

        "comment": "The thing about independent publishing I suppose is that you don’t get the benefit of a good editor. For example, court transcripts in an exhibit word not interfere with the flow of reading so much. Integrated writing rather than “Michael” sections or “Allyson” sections would have been nice.\n\nBut the story is so compelling and detailed, so elucidative, that I ignored that stuff and was riveted. Sandra no doubt has a serious cluster B personality disorder, probably borderline comorbid with narcissistic with histrionic for kicks. She is vety very I’ll. You could also say she is evil. Pure evil. If you say that, then you have to add her mentally ill disciples, Michelle Macdonald and the rest of Sandra’s enablers and coconspirators.\n\nThis is not the first father to find himself in this situation (parental alienation and false accusations of abuse), but few have suffered so much from the kidnapping of their children and endured and fought so hard. This is an important story to tell and never forget. The culprits continue to this day to spread their delusions, this book tells the actual story. Sad, but worth reading and never forgetting.",

Sandra was unbelievably evil and likely mentally\nill, and the courts were much more respectful that I didn’t think she deserved then she ever exhibited is the or out of the courts.\nIt did have a happy ending which David and the children deserved. It was heartwarming the children finally ended up in a normal family setting",

        "comment": "What I really loved about the book was that it was a true story, and it happened not too far from where I live. I do not think the people that were involved with tearing this family apart got near enough out of the court system. For what Sandra put the children and David through, she should still be in jail. It was a excellent book and I would recommend for anybody who likes true stories to read this.",

As a Parent ,grand parent and great grandparent it is unbelievable that there are people who could behave the way the mother and her people did. I don't know is this is fiction or based on a real situation but I guarantee this type of thing happens in real life and it needs to be fought by everyone who is truly concerned with children",
