A fantasy like you've never read before.\" ―#1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout\n\n\nEnter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from New York Times bestselling author Rebecca Yarros\n\nTwenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.\n\nBut when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.\n\nWith fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.\n\nShe’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.\n\nYet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.\n\nFriends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out: graduate or die.\n\nThe Empyrean series is best enjoyed in order.\nReading Order:\nBook #1 Fourth Wing\nBook #2 Iron Flame",

        "comment": "Everything you're hearing about Rebecca Yarros' Fourth Wing is absolutely the truth! If you're ready for an action packed, magically breathtaking, and heartbreakingly romantic read that will steal your breath away then this is the read for you. Also be aware that this is most definitely an adult novel. While the heroine is just past teen years, you could call this New Adult. I don't think I've seen the *-word used so many times on one page before and throughout a novel as a whole, but there you go!\n\nRight away I found myself connecting to Violet in certain ways. She's the daughter of a powerful commander mother, her older brother died a war hero, and her older sister is one of the best dragon riders in the provinces. But unlike her siblings, Violet does not have that physical strength. As a child she had medical issues and that turned her into the adult woman she is today, who can easily be broken. But for untold reasons, her mother wants her to be a rider instead of a scribe as she longed to be.\n\nWith no other choice she's off to the school that will either train her to be a dragon rider or she will die trying. Even those who are better fit than her will still lose their lives somewhere in their three years of training. Violet isn't happy with the course that's forced upon her, but she's not going to back down from the impossible challenge set before her. Even when she learns that a great deal of the students at this school are children of the dissenters. There was a great battle a few years ago, one her brother fought in and lost his life when a man was set against the king of the provinces and wanted to tear down the structure of life everyone lived by. It was an ugly battle, but the king granted mercy upon the dissenters' children if they were to join the riders, which that in itself is almost a death sentence since not many can survive the years leading up to graduation. And at the helm of all this is Xander, the son of the man who started the war that ultimately killed her brother...and Violet's mother was the one to execute his father, so there's no love lost between these two.\n\nSo naturally, we all know what's to come between them! But I will say that it's not something that happens instantaneously. In fact, this was an ultimate enemies to lovers situation as Violet is certain that Xander would rather murder her than let the grueling trials of college do her in. That and the fact that Violet makes an enemy of one of the other students on her first day. Surprisingly, not a child of a dissenter but just a regular old d***** b**.\n\nEvery first year is training to be physically fit and worthy of becoming a dragon rider. That eventually leads to trying to earn themselves a dragon, for the rider doesn't get to pick the dragon, the dragon picks the rider.\n\nThere's almost 500 pages of story in this book and a lot happens over the course of a year. Violet makes friends, she makes enemies. It's a wild ride for sure! The story even reminded me of another one I read years ago, but instead of dragons that one involved vampires (naturally!) and while I saw some similarities with the competition within the school that trains young adults to be protectors essentially, but that is about all they shared. I was expecting to see a lot of \"school days\" scenarios going down in this one and while we do get that sense with classes and tests and challenges, there was a whole lot more to this one. Though Violet appears weak at first glance, she is a force to be reckoned with and I so, so admired her for all that she accomplishes while being looked upon as someone who is weak and pitiful.\n\nI also wasn't expecting to see Violet make true friendships in this one! At a cutthroat school where only the best of the best can win and even those who do win may not even be chosen by a dragon, you don't really expect anyone to be genuine or kind. But I was happy to be proven wrong in this one.\n\nThen there's the every complicated relationship brewing between Violet and Xaden. Xaden being the son of the most hated man in the provinces, he's a dangerous unknown entity and yet he and Violet continually circle one another. They have an odd dynamic where they are never quite sure of the other one and eventually that evolves into something deeper. Honestly, none of it was a surprise. I mean the blurb pretty much tells you that without telling you that, as any reader could tell you.\n\nI do enjoy the slow burn romance though. The ones that take time to build and where the lovers start out as enemies of a kind.\n\nThis book was just full of surprises and I pretty much loved every moment of it! The pacing was sort of a slow buildup but in a way it was more like Yarros was slowly reeling the reader in by giving little nibbles of the ultimately entertaining moments and then letting us simmer before reeling us in deeper as the pages went by. True, some fighting moments felt a bit drawn out but in a sense, I can kind of understand why those moments had to take up so much time.\n\nThe ending...oh that ending! As soon as I finish writing this I am going back to read the blurb of Iron Flame because I wouldn't let myself read that the other day when it was revealed! The ending is something of a cliffhanger, but not one where you scream at the agony of the wait ahead of you. It's the kind of explosive ending that just gears you up for the next book and all the excitement that's to come from it! You won't scream in agony, but you will have emotions. My emotions are rolling all over the place! From the looks of things, Fourth Wing was Yarros' first Fantasy novel and what a novel it was! I mean you can't go wrong with DRAGONS! Dragons are everything in fantasy! All I can really say that the hype behind this series is justified! This was an incredibly epic and amazing read that held me riveted from start to finish! Violet is my new favorite heroine that I can relate to! She's a girl I will root for until the very end! If you're ready to be reeled into the spellbinding new fantasy everyone is raving about then be sure to pick up a copy soon!\n\nAnd on a side note, I can't decide if it's a good thing or not that we get the sequel before the end of the year because the real question remains...what happens AFTER THAT?! How long will that wait be? Time will tell I suppose, but I'll be here for it for sure!\n\nOverall Rating 5/5 stars",

        "comment": "I first came across Fourth Wing when I noticed it in the #1 position on Amazon's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2023 So Far. But beyond that selection, I looked at how the reviews were trending. At the time, there were more than 21,000 reviews (it's now about to crest 40,000), and the average was a whopping 4.8 stars. It has to be good for that many people to love it, right? In need of a palate cleanser after the difficult read that was The Whispers, I decided I'd limit the likelihood of another clunker and see what all the hype is about. And I'm happy to say that I get why so many people love this book: it's pretty great.\n\nFourth Wing is set at Basgiath War College in the mythical land of Navarre. It opens on Conscription Day, where thousands of twenty-year-olds assemble to take their place among the healers, scribes, or infantry. The most elite of them try to join the most selective branch and become dragon riders.\n\nOur heroine is Violet Sorrengail. Bookish and smart, yet frail, she always imagined a future as a scribe, just as her father had been. But her mother is a rider and a general in the army, and she has other ideas. Against Violet's wishes, her mother insists she attempt to be a rider as well. But this isn't an idle push in a different direction. The stakes are the highest possible for those trying to become riders: from the opening conscription challenge through bonding with a dragon, there are dozens of opportunities to fail, and any failure when attempting to become a rider equals death.\n\nIn addition to the general peril of the tasks at hand, there is also a ruthlessness among the members of the War College. Fewer classmates means better opportunities to bond a dragon, and so the murder of fellow classmates, while perhaps not encouraged, is certainly allowed, making every waking moment one filled with potential death. Yarros creates an interesting caste within the college of students who carry \"rebellion relics\". They are the children of adults involved in a rebellious uprising six years prior. All of the adults were executed, and the children were only spared execution as well by being forced into conscription as riders. As a result, they all tend to possess a brooding darkness -- you could think of them as the \"Slytherin\" of Basgiath. To further complicate things for Violet, those children of the rebels all intensely hate her because Violet's mother was responsible for ordering their parents' execution.\n\nThe novel is packed with a ton of genre-bending elements. There is the basic plot -- Violet's unlikely journey through her first year at Basgiath War College -- which stirred up memories of one of my all-time favorite books, Pat Conroy's The Lords of Discipline, based on Conroy's first year at The Citadel military college. There are dragons and dragon riders, which of course evokes memories of plenty of fantasy novels, with Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series top of mind. And then there's some romance, and a potential love triangle, which starts out feeling like something from a YA novel, but ends up a lot more R-rated and steamy, and more akin to what you might find in a novel with Fabio on the cover. Add to this a nuanced backstory and some misdirection on who the reader should trust and believe, and Fourth Wing truly has something for everyone.\n\nThere is depth to the story and characters, which elevates the story and I'm sure plays a big role in the stellar reviews. Yarros handles relationships well, whether it's the strained relationship between Violet and her mother, the love between Violet and her sister, or the friendships Violet forges with her classmates. The romance is the romance; honestly I could have done without it, and while it was almost humorous at times, it works for what it is meant to be. Yarros also does a standout job of presenting how her characters handle loss. Whether it's grieving the loss of family members or their classmates, there is an undercurrent of sadness and longing that affects many of the characters and hardens them to the task at hand. Despite the intensity of their training, Yarros does a pretty good job reminding us that they're only in their early twenties and still figuring out a lot of life.\n\nI suspect a lot of the hype and enjoyment of the book is related to how Yarros turns a straightforward \"year 1 as a student story\" into something more. I can't help but compare that to the Harry Potter books (except, of course, Harry never had hot magical sex with Ginny Weasley -- at least not within the pages of any of the books!). Those novels changed significantly for me with the third book in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Where books 1 and 2 were decent and straightforward YA novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban took the story to a more nuanced and mature level. Yarros does the same thing here, but all within the pages of a single book. I get why people are so drawn to the story.\n\nOverall, it's a winner. It's fun, and while it feels derivative of several other novels, it also combines those stories and plots in its own unique way. Book 2, Iron Flame, is already set for release this November (I've already ordered my copy!), and so if you fall in love with the characters, you'll have the opportunity to spend more time with them before long (well, at least with those who survive Fourth Wing). It's a compelling read and like the other 40,000+ readers who have this trending at almost 5 stars, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

    "synopsis": "He didn’t know he was looking for a home until he found one.\n\nSavannah was unlike any city Derek had ever been to. For the first time since his arrival in Cydaria, Derek actually met a respectable city lord. Natalie Savannah and the city she ruled were much more than he’d imagined.\n\nWith this combination, Derek made the decision to put down roots by building a shop from scratch and moving his people in. He was even able to get Silvi the beloved kitchen that she so desired, along with personally meeting Alanah Swan and learning new things about the new system he was thrown into—things that only someone who was truly strong would know.\n\nNot only that, but with his help, the Kingdom of Cydaria was able to find and deal with a threat from within in the form of Gerald Torith. With the threat of Torith now taken care of, Derek can finally relax knowing that the terrible man can never use those he cares about to get to him, and hopefully, the Kingdom of Cydaria will be able to use their new captive to weed out other threats to the kingdom.\n\nHowever, none of that has anything to do with Derek any longer. He lent his help and got the job done. Now, he’s looking forward to the auction and any gains it may bring him.\n\nMaybe it’s time for him to relax; or maybe a prince has other plans for him. Maybe new trials await.\n\nDon’t miss the fourth installment of Derek’s journey in the System Universe. Join Derek in this unique combination of the LitRPG, Isekai, and Slice of Life genres. He has friends, a bond that should last forever, and even a home. What more could our overpowered protagonist ask for?",

        "comment": "The Main Character is vastly overpowered and the outcome of any conflict involving him is known before the conflict commences, which removes much of the suspense. What primarily moves this story is the question of whether the MC can keep his friends safe, how their skills will develop, the comradery between the MC and his friends, and the undeniable satisfaction of seeing bad guys get annihilated.\n\nIn book 4 the MC finally runs into some foes he cannot easily dispatch, and a war also breaks out which raises the possibility of new levels of opposition for him. Sadly enough Silvi was mostly sidelined in this book, but I hope, and expect, she will be a much larger part of the next story in order to prove that some bunnies are indeed more warlike than dragonkin are.\n\nThis series and the Path of Ascension series are currently my two favorite book series and it makes my day when either author releases a new book. Sadly enough each new book is devoured the same day it is released. I have read all the books in this series twice, except for the one which was released yesterday, and I highly recommend this series to any readers who enjoy LitRPG. Many thanks, and a few dollars, to the author for this enjoyable series.",

Up until now all the action has been focused on Derek. There were a few segnents, here and there, from other's POV, but mostly it is all Derek, all the time.\n\nIn book IV, Derek and his family are seperated in both time and space. This means we get to see things from other members of the family and it's pretty cool. Especially when we get to see how well they handle upcoming conflict!\n\nThe other big change is Derek is no longer the only hot-shot over powered character. With a new type of dungeon he has to work as a member of a team and rely on others in order to romp and stomp his way through the trials.\n\nFinally, we get to see a tiny bit more of where Derek came from and the people he's left behind.\n\nLooking forward to book V!",

        "comment": "I consider The Martian my favorite fictional novel of the last 15-20 years. The movie was incredible in that they actually followed the book closer than 99% of other films based on books. It remains my favorite movie of the last 15 years or so as well. I don't know anyone (personally) that loves either of them as much as I do.\n\nWith that said, I was REALLY looking forward to Artemis. It was good...but, it was certainly not in the same caliber as The Martian was (at least not for me). I enjoyed it a lot, however and appreciated how author Andy Weir chose to go in a completely different direction and not just rehash another similar story, which I am certain would have been great as well.\n\nAs a result, I was cautious regarding Project Hail Mary. It sounded a little too close to The Martian, but yet, also different in that the circumstances simply could not be more opposite and the stakes so much higher. I'm trying to figure out the best way to summarize without giving too much away from this utterly compelling novel. As I read several reviews, I noticed a recurring theme: SCIENCE. Lots and LOTS of science. Holy cow, they were right. Many years ago I read Apollo 13 and Jim Lovell and his co-writer, try as they might, simply could not dumb down Orbital Mechanics anywhere near enough for me to have even a minor clue as to what they were attempting to say...I just skipped 90% of it and hoped that the sentences written afterwards, would help to make sense of what I had just skimmed over. I'm a lot of things, but a math wizard is definitely not one of them. Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) had an amazing talent for dumbing-down the science of what he was trying to explain in ways that genuinely made sense (most of the time). Not everyone has this talent, and I would say Andy Weir falls squarely in between. He's certainly better than Jim Lovell, but not quite as good as Crichton. But then again, outside of a science textbook, I haven't really read anything with quite as MUCH science as Project Hail Mary. So maybe he's just as good, but he just puts more science into his books than Crichton, maybe that's it...? Either way, be prepared for a lot of astonishingly interesting science within the pages of this novel...and I DO mean a LOT. I don't say this to make you wary or steer you away...on the contrary, Andy Weir has a special talent for making hard science truly entertaining.\n\nThe book opens with an absolutely amazing and frightening premise: an astronaut awakes from an induced coma to find the only other two people on board have died at some point along their journey...but it gets worse. He has no idea who he is, or why he's on the ship, and oh yeah, they look to be a long way from home. A really, REALLY long way from home. In fact, the sun he sees isn't actually OUR sun at all. He's managed to leave our solar system entirely. And he has no idea why.\n\n((Minor Spoilers)) The book goes through some clever flash-backs, which set the stage for why the mission happens, and slowly, carefully explains how they managed to get so far away from earth in such a short amount of time. Basically, earth's sun seems to be dying. At the rate of decay, we have maybe 19 years left before the gradual cooling has catastrophic consequences resulting in the death of billions (best guess). Why the sun is dimming is quite the conundrum in the first place. Turns out it really isn't dying, it's being killed by an outside source...which turns out to be easily the greatest find in history. It's alien life, and they are using the sun for food, essentially. It's alien life, but not intelligent life. But still, wow! ALIENS, right???\n\nAfter this monumental discovery, and some tremendous research done by the most improbable scientist, the investigation into what is happening and why and what to do about it expands exponentially to other nations in order to pool all the resources possible to hopefully save the sun, and by extension, the human race as well. They learn. A LOT. A plan is put together, and with the help of the newly discovered microscopic alien life, which can also double as a power source (along with a few other nifty surprises), they begin to create one last, Hail Mary that could very well be the last chance we might have to save earth. It's audacious. It's dangerous, and it is absolutely critical that it succeed.\n\nAs our astronaut's memory slowly unravels, so does his identity: Ryland Grace. He's a teacher on earth. Just a science teacher. Not even a college professor. He's amazingly smart, though. But he's no astronaut...and certainly not one who would volunteer to go on a one-way mission to another solar system to \"try\" and save humanity. Yet here he is. Alone. light years from earth, trying to solve the biggest riddle in all of human history. Ryland accepts his situation, such as it is, with relative indifference (for the most part). It doesn't matter HOW he got here. He's here now and he may as well use that time to be as productive as possible, right? Along the way, he unravels even more information regarding the microscopic alien life which is slowly dimming our sun during some additional flashbacks. The aliens, dubbed, \"Astrophage\" are quite the galactic plague as it turns out. Stars all over the galaxy are also losing their light, all due to the little buggers. All that is, except one particular star named, Tau Ceti. Now why would that one star be unaffected by Astrophage, when every single star around it has been affected to some degree. The plan is to go there and figure it out and send the information back, hopefully in time to save the sun before the damage to earth is beyond repair.\n\nThere is an incredible amount of stuff going on. The story switches from Tau Ceti to flashbacks of how the whole mission was planned and implemented (which is VERY entertaining, especially Director Stratt, who may actually be my favorite character in the entire novel). Weir is becoming quite adept at building tension, and abruptly switching the story from Tau Ceti back to earth and building more of the backstory then switching back to Tau Ceti. Keeping it all in check and most importantly, interesting all while mixing in a healthy dose of science, which I am to understand is pretty much all genuine, is quite the juggling act. I have long known science can be astronomically entertaining (see what I did there?) when done right...but unfortunately very few people in a position to teach science actually know the best way to create that interest in others. I can say without reservation, Andy Weir definitely knows how to do it...at least in written form.\n\nThere is so much I want to say more regarding this truly phenomenal story, but I simply cannot without ruining a lot of the fun and surprises revealed along the way...and it is killing me to keep it locked in. Though I labeled a spoiler warning earlier, I don't think it gave away any more than what the author himself has revealed in interviews he has done regarding the book, and what you can glean from reading the summary here and just a couple other reviews. Tying all of that science together is truly astonishing to me. The creativity to put it into a novel that is remarkably exciting to read is nothing more than incredible talent. Kudo's to Andy Weir for not just hitting a home run, Project Hail Mary is a Grand Slam all the way. I truly did not want this story to end. By the way, I enjoyed the ending quite a bit. I don't know if everyone will. But it was fine for me. I think the ending screams \"sequel\" at some point too. A lot was left open-ended (IMO) and I wouldn't mind reading a follow-up to this. It doesn't HAVE to happen, but there are a lot of ways where the story could go if Andy chose to do it. Just sayin'.\n\nJust run out and buy this book.",

        "comment": "According to a 2003 article on the NASA website, \"NASA-funded scientists have recently learned that cloud-to-ground lightning frequently strikes the ground in two or more places ...\" and that the third and fourth strokes of a lightning flash will follow the same path as the second stroke. In other words, lightning DOES strike the same place twice.\n\nBut you don't need to search the web for this information. If you want proof that lightning strikes twice, just read Andy Weir's newest book, Project Hail Mary, and you'll see that Weir has created a giant sci-fi bestseller, in the same electric path as The Martian.\n\nRyland Grace has a puzzle on his hands. He wakes up without a clue as to where he is, but he seems to be alone except for a computer AI that was keeping him alive. Unfortunately it didn't seem to be doing the same for two others in his ... wherever he is ... as he notes the decayed corpses in their creches on the ... well, it's a ship. A space ship. And bit by bit Grace puts the pieces of the puzzle together.\n\nAn alien microbe has been discovered. Ryland Grace is brought on to the science team to learn more about the life form because Grace, currently a middle school science teacher, wrote papers about the notation that there does not need to be water to create life. Only in a biozone such as Earth's would water be needed, but other building blocks could be used in other systems.\n\nThe science community as a whole mocked Grace, which is why he left and went on to teach kids, but now, he may be the best suited to understand this new life form. And as he remembers more and more, he also remembers that this life form is feeding on the energy output of the sun, which is decreasing the energy that gets to Earth, which spells disaster - as in the end of all life as currently known - on Earth if something isn't done.\n\nScientists discover that Sol isn't the only star that is losing its energy output - likely due to the alien consumption, but that there is one star, in the center of all the known stars losing their energy, that remains constant with its output. In which case, the answer to the survival for Earth is likely found there, at Tau Ceti.\n\nThe world's best scientific minds come together (by force and coercion) to create a ship that can get to Tau Ceti in twelve years (using the alien microbe as fuel) with shuttle pods to bring back answers to how to save the planet, but for the crew, it's a one-way trip.\n\nKnowing why he's there is only the first puzzle for Grace. Now he has to figure out how to save Earth. There's a very small window of time for him to discover the way to save the human race and get the answers sent back. Take too long and the shuttles will return to a dead planet.\n\nThis book is amazing.\n\nAuthor Andy Weir brings us back to the magic that made The Martian so successful - an abandoned scientist trying to survive. But Ryland Grace's story is more complicated because he's not just trying to survive, but also help humanity survive.\n\nThere's lots and lots of science - which is part of Weir's writing signature - and there's also a really wonderful story.\n\nIt's hard for me to tell you just what I liked about this book because anything I write will be a spoiler and a huge part of the joy in this book is making the discoveries with Ryland Grace.\n\nGrace is our main character, but through the liberal use of flashbacks, we have a full cast of characters - at least one quite important to the story. Everyone is unique and individual which makes it easy to read, but just as with The Martian, where Mark Watney's personality carries the story, Ryland Grace here is the smart-mouth, sometimes funny, obsessed scientist infusing his personal tastes into his discoveries. He's also quite smart - which is good since he will need his intellect to save all of humanity.\n\nThis is a page-turner. I did not want to put this book down. Neither did my 21 year old son who picked up my copy after I was well into it and finished it before I did. And days later he's still talking about how much he liked it and quoting sections of it to me at the dinner table.\n\nI hope Ballantine Books will do a very large print run because this is going to be huge seller and you definitely don't want to miss out on the biggest thing to come out in 2021.\n\nLooking for a good book? Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir is proof that lightning strikes twice as this has all the excitement and energy of Weir's debut novel, with a more complicated storyline that will hold the reader all the way to the end.",

        "comment": "5⭐️/ 3🌶️\n\nWhen I heard about this book being described as, “Hunger Games” but make it fantasy and with vampires, I knew I had to read this for myself! This also had some slow burn romance, alliances with a certain other competitor, danger, suspense, action, and a whole lot of blood as you’d except with a story revolves around vampires.\n\nSet in a world filled with different factions of vampires, there was a competition that was held every hundred years called, the Kejari, the ultimate battle against other competitors in order to win something from the goddess of death. For Oraya, it was her chance to prove herself and hopefully win the competition for her chance at a greater life. As the adopted daughter of the Nightborn vampire King, Vincent, he took her when she was little and grew up surrounded by predators her whole life. Oraya may have been a human, but she was a formidable warrior in her own right, especially with the training she got from her “father”. With the games, it was all about strategy and strength, and as Oraya would later find herself doing, making alliances in order to survive and win.\n\nThis was my first book to read by Carissa Broadbent so, I was very curious and intrigued by this book in particular. Right away from the beginning, I found the story to be very interesting with the way Oraya was adopted by Vincent and years later she became a stronger woman. Even from the first chapter, I could sense that Oraya wasn’t the type of woman to go down without a fight, and with her entering the Kejari, I had faith she would overcome any obstacles in her way.\n\nThe beginning didn’t waste any time with the action and the level of skills that Oraya needed to utilize in order to survive. I could see why people have been comparing this to, “Hunger Games”, with the level of savagery, blood, gore, and absolute chaos that ensued in each of the trials, it was no joke, every single second counted. At any moment, it could have been Oraya’s last, but thankfully with her level of control and precision, she was able to survive. Then once Raihn was introduced, I was immediately wondering, “who is this vampire? what’s his deal? And why do I get the feeling something’s going to happen between him and Oraya?” Raihn was the type of vampire that was equally powerful, strategic, and observant. Raihn didn’t waste any time making his presence known among the other competitors and how would you ask? Well that’s easy, by simply unaliving his fellow opponent in front of everyone so, all of them knew that was just a taste of what he was capable of. Although, when Raihn and Oraya first met, it literally ended with Oraya stabbing him in the thigh, but hey, she was trying to survive, can’t blame her. I liked the banter between Raihn and Oraya especially with the old time favorite of, “stop or I’ll stab you/ what are you going to do, stab me?” trope haha.\n\nThe beginning also set up the scene in how Oraya was adopted by Vincent (King of Nightborn Vampires) a.k.a. her adopted father. Even from a young age, Oraya knew she would never be safe so, with that in mind she was always mindful of her surroundings and trained to keep herself protected. I liked that Oraya wasn’t necessarily a vulnerable character who didn’t know what to do, she had the means to protect herself, was strong, but with that kind of mindset, she always kept her emotions locked up as to not get in the way of focusing. Kind of made me realize just how much Oraya did in order to survive her life even way before she was in the Kejari.\n\nWith each trial that Oraya was faced with, not only did she have to fight for her life, but also learn new things about herself and other such as, Raihn. For starters, I didn’t expect Oraya to be able to use magic, but with the way she unexpectedly found out through an unexpected moment with Raihn, it was clear that there was even more hidden beneath the surface that Oraya was capable of. As the story went, I found myself loving Oraya and the way she went about the games, sure there was a lot of blood and multiple injuries along the way, but every time she was able to get back up and finish the trial. Even Raihn was someone I found myself quickly intrigued by, especially learning a bit about his backstory was eye opening. Together, Oraya and Raihn became a strong duo, and again I really enjoyed their banter and slow friendship (dare I say) that started to form along the way.\n\nI also loved the progression in Oraya and Raihn’s relationship from allies to kind of friends to lovers. While there was some romance, I wouldn’t say this was romance heavy, more like a slow burn romance if anything. Oraya and Raihn slowly but surely become more than allies, they became close in an unexpected way, and believe it or not felt that “unspoken thing” between them or at least that was my impression while reading. Even before things got romantic and the sexual tension started to happen later on, I was already loving how Oraya and Raihn were together in the beginning. The banter was great, the team work (lol), recognizing how the other person was that only they could pick up on the smallest of details really highlighted just how much Oraya and Raihn had gotten close. The moment in the cave (IYKYK!) was one where I was like, “OMG OMG!” But again, it also spoke to the level of trust that Oraya and Raihn had developed over the course of the story. Plus it was a pretty steamy moment if I say so myself. I remember hearing someone say that they didn’t like the added smut scenes in this book, but I have to disagree, it didn’t take away from Oraya and Raihn’s relationship, if anything the fact that she did what she did in the cave was kind of a big deal especially considering what she went through as a teenager (flashback mentioned earlier in book). All this to say that I loved Oraya and Raihn together and as individuals!\n\nOMG OMG OMG OMG! This by far exceeded my expectations like, “WTF?!” Especially towards the end when things started to get really intense, I was shook! Surprised! Flabbergasted! And just a rollercoaster of emotions at the ending. Just when I thought I knew what I was getting myself into…WRONG! The twists and turns in this story were unexpected, but in the best way possible and not to mention revelations that changed the course of Oraya and Raihn’s lives! Phew, if you couldn’t tell, I was really shocked by the turn of events. This was an action packed adventure filled with death defying challenges, bits of political drama from the different Houses of Vampire factions, alliances, sprinkles of tension, a slow burn romance well worth the wait, and a whole lot of me constantly dropping my jaw to the ground at what I read as if it was unfolding in real time before my very eyes. Oraya was literally such a strong female lead, with so much power within her, the skill and precision she wielded both with her blades and strategies were impressive. I also loved learning more about her and seeing her open up a bit about her fears/ vulnerabilities which, added more depth to her character amongst all that was happening in the story. Raihn, omg, that vampire was charming, quick wit, always bantering with Oraya, and equally a formidable, fierce, deadly warrior you wouldn’t want to cross paths with. The way Oraya and Raihn first started off at the beginning compared to the very ending was a drastic change that highlighted they came a long way, plus nothing would ever be the same after the events that went down! I would say if you’ve been wanting to get back into fantasy books or just looking for a new book in general I would highly recommend this book!",

        "comment": "If you loved these series then Crowns of Nyaxia is a must read series for you:\n✔ Hunger Games\n✔Savage Lands by Stacie Marie Brown\n✔The Bridge Kingdom. by Danielle Jensen\n\nOraya has fought for her life and Vincent the King of the House of Night ,the most feared Vampire in the world has trained her to one day take his place. To make it through the trials it is kill or be killed and Oraya's fight scenes are some of the most brilliant bloody writing I have read. Her fierce skill compares to Brexley Kovacs in Savage Lands ..but Oraya sees a battle as a chess match , and eyes the field as one to dominate. I was completely utterly blown away. Then the magic systems , the one she had no idea she had ..👨‍🍳💋.\nThere are plot twists ..I had no doubt that Oraya was going to be the victor at the end. But all the omissions what Rahin didnt tell her, what Vincent didnt tell her makes her even more lethal going into book two. Everyone underestimates her; but never has the proverb \"the truth will set you free more than IN THE END of this book.\nIf you love Enemies to Lovers Oraya and Rahin's slow burn relationship will be added to your fave Fantasy couples, until she found how he lied..well then I cant wait to see how he begs to get back in her good graces in book 2. Oraya is stronger than that, she like Brexley Kovacs was raised to be a machine , to be tough and rely on her own self to make it though life. It is sad at the end of the book she is back to feeling she can trust no one. This events at the end will break you , have a box of tissues ! I have no doubt that Oraya will make a fierce leader and I cannot to read what direction Carissa writes this in; the fierce battle between Vampire Houses has begun, and the battle I can see will be as fierce as a Fae War , and Oraya wont need dragons like Daenerys in Game of Thrones ..she is the weapon of war.\nThe history of her world Carissa did a superb job worldbuilding , and taking her time gradually telling her readers the events that brought us to today. It was a bitter pill for Oraya to know humans were viewed no more than livestock for slaughter through her eyes you felt her pain. Will Rahin and Oraya make a better future for the world between humans and Vampires? I cannot wait to dive in to book 2 and find out. Loving Oraya has changed Rahin , i truly hope we get more of his point of view in book two. That is my only negative in this book; I felt it could have been even better with multiple POVs ; with only having Oraya's we miss the full perspective of events as they happened. For there is more than one side of a story and the truth in history.",

        "comment": "Having heard much raving about this series, I was poking around on Amazon when I saw this collector's edition. It is indeed gorgeous, although I do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark. The gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain, paper, black covers that are on most hardbacks today, and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf. It wasn't the first time I had bought a book for the cover.\n\nAside from hearing reviews from fans, I also saw a reference to the book when reading about Patricia A McKillip's _Winter Rose_, which I had recently read, and its connection to the ballad of Tam Lin. This same fairy tale apparently had influence on Holly Black's _Tithe_, also. Although the High Lord in Maas's tale is named Tamlin, the story is obviously a retelling of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" The story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon,\" wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear, and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich. Whereas neither \"Beauty and the Beast\" nor \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\" have fairy characters, aside from a witch or enchantress here and there, in the story Tam Lin, he is identified as an elf. In Maas's retelling, which court is cursed to wear masks, Tamlin's friend's mask is clearly stated as a fox, whereas Tamlin's mask is only vaguely described, and he is often referred to as a \"beast.\" The lack of description was a tad infuriating.\n\nWhile set in a fairy tale period of time past, the main character clearly has \"modern\" ideas. She has no mother and a weak father figure and, furthermore, was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters, despite the fact that she is the youngest. The family has only recently fallen into poverty, and the main character's upbringing has been neglected. She learns to hunt to feed the family, and, unlike the book-loving Belle of the Disney fairy tale, no one bothers to teach her how to read, although she is presented with a library, at which point, if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated, you now know for sure. According to the Internet, the character's name \"Feyre\" means \"Fair, Beautiful,\" like the name \"Belle.\" DYSWSDT? I myself am not a fan of retellings, and even less of \"modern\" retellings, although I do appreciate influences and notes here and there.\n\nAs a novel, the story has a single plot line. I have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion, but a novel requires a bit more substance. Although it was interesting enough for me to finish, I am not sure that I feel compelled to read the rest of the series, particularly if there is no matching collector's edition. For me, the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end, and I had already guessed the answer to the riddle. I found Feyre's modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire, and I found her difficult to like, which is basically how I feel about most \"strong female characters.\" I do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong. Stubborn, I can get. Stubborn and dumb at the same time? No.\n\nACOTAR has a Lexile score of 880, which puts it at the lower end of a 4th grade reading level (700-1160). You won't learn any new big words, and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the \"hero's journey\" template little to no deviation (i.e., no big surprises). It is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin, and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book, as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters. The descriptions of the fairy land (not merely a realm) were not as detailed as those in Julie Kagawa's _The Iron Fey_ series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals. The writing was a bit awkward at several points where one character's actions were in the same paragraph with another character's dialogue, so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader, and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas. So, was it bad? Obviously not that bad, since I finished it. Will I read more of her stories? I can't say for sure, but probably not unless they issue an attractive collector's edition worthy of the bookshelf. It satisfied my curiosity, but for Fey-related books, I recommend Jim Butcher's Dresden Series and Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey Series. Both have mind-blowing descriptions and intricacies. I'm always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if it's possible. So, I gave it three stars for being \"okay\" plus one for a really nice cover.",

        "comment": "This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars. I loved it!\n\nHere are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):\n\n★ FAIRYTALE RETELLING\nI was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling. I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas). However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings. Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie.\n\nI think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite. Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!). Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story. But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.\n\nThere were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed. For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items. However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party. I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him. Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting). So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel. Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the \"Beast\" story line. However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all.\n\nOverall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything. I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with. Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.\n\n★ GENRE\nWhile we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book. I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult. However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think \"Whoa! This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature.\"\n\nLooking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult. But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult. Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel. I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author. I personally have no problem with this genre. However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.\n\nI love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more. I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19). And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too. (There is no shame in my game... Because, who am I kidding? I have no game.) I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory.\n\nI'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer. She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places. I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.\n\n★ FEYRE, THE PROTAGONIST\nWhen I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien: a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool. However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human. She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character. Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to. She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).\n\nIn the beginning, Feyre is not very likable. She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed. But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way. Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting. Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures. Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.\n\n★ TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLE\nSince we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.\n\nTamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities. He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. But, he is not perfect. He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.\n\nHowever, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.\n\nBecause Rhysand.\n\nRhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre. And, I can't say that I hate him. I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre). He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.\n\nI am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan). I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.\n\n★ SUPPORTING CHARACTERS\nWhile Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.\n\nFirst, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend. He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her. They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief. He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.\n\nThere is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess. She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre. She is cold, calculating, and cruel. But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level, I find her evil ways to be too much at times. However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.\n\nAnd of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier. He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2. I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS\nMaas' Writing\nI believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best. As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person. Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters. But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.\n\nFaerie World\nI literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama). Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly. It seems like a literal heaven on earth.\n\nOther than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities. I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world. And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer. It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.\n\n***\n\nThere is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses. I LOVED this book! I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it. Because Sarah J. Maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.",

He sets out to honor his late friend by helping Nina Dozier and her son, John, whom Shelby greatly admired. Although what Michael does for Nina is life changing, his actions also evoke the wrath of John’s father, a member of one of the most violent street gangs in Los Angeles.\n\nBut an even greater threat is descending: the Internal Security Agency’s most vicious assassin, Durand Calaphas. Calaphas will stop at nothing to get his man. If Michael dies twice, he will not live a third time.\n\nFrom the tarnished glamour of Beverly Hills to the streets of South Central to a walled estate in Rancho Santa Fe, only Michael can protect Nina and John—and ensure that light survives in a rapidly darkening world.",

Not the otherworldly, but as in this book, the hero sees human nature and manages to clean it up.\n\nThat last few books, I've read, especially this one - makes me wish Mr. Koontz ran the world.\n\nSeems like Mr. Koontz is getting more, erm, philosophical, maybe. I hesitate to use the word \"preach\" as in preachy because these books are not pedantic or reads like sermons, no. They are wonderfully crafted stories by an author who gives exact and true meaning to the expression \"wordsmith\".\n\nIn short, I like everything about this book.\n\nI am a little disappointed- I would have enjoyed some authors notes. Perhaps explaining where he got the ideas for this book, whether we are close to the technology described...etc...",

As a tech expert, I can say that there were some liberties taken in that regard, but it is a fictional story. Unlimited access to the internet would not necessarily give you access to encrypted systems. I found everything else to be insightful, honest and I applaud Mr. Koontz bravery in speaking such truths when so many today ignore the truth for the propaganda they are served. Even when the stories fall apart, the perpetrators move on to amplifying the next falsehood. I cannot express how wonderful it was to hear a talented author putting the truth to ink, so future generations will realize, we were not all duped by the propaganda. I remain hopeful their will be future generations and “the new truth” is defeated. There are not shades of truth, something is true or it isn’t.",

However, it’s not my favorite book in the series (I’m writing this online review after completing the series BUT from the notes I took while reading for the first time).\no We certainly do love a Rhysand show, don’t we? We all made the mistake of liking Tamlin in the first book, you’re not alone. I love Rhys’ character so much. Brooding, bad boy with the good reasons. We love that.\no OVERVIEW: SPOILERS. Feyre returned to the Spring Court with Tamlin. Only to find that Tamlin had become so overprotective of her she wasn’t allowed to leave the manor. So she stayed there planning for everything with Ianthe, the priestess that Tamlin had brought in. Planning the wedding, planning the flowers, things that she couldn’t have cared any less about. We find Feyre falling more and more into the darkness. However, while she is there fighting with Tamlin on everything, Rhysand shows up to make good on his bargain after 3 months of peace where everyone assumed he’d forgotten about it. Although she doesn’t want to go, she does. And there, she learns to read and write because Rhys saw in the trials that she couldn’t. He teaches her with sentences like “Rhysand is the most handsome high lord”, and the like. We love that for him & his twisted sense of humor and narcissism.\no However, Feyre captures a Suriel (our favorite gossip queen) and he tells her “Stay with the High Lord and see everything righted” So, the day of the wedding of Tamlin and Feyre (feeling like she is doing as the Suriel told her) comes and she has a hideous dress that she hates on that Ianthe picked out. As she is walking own the isle toward Tamlin she is silently shouting in her head for ANYONE to stop it. She is beginning to panic. And a special dark knight in shining armor shows up just in time as Feyre stopped in the aisle because she couldn’t go any further. Rhys then whisks her away.\no There she decides that she is not returning to the Spring Court and being locked in that house.\no So begins Feyre’s real healing at Velaris and the Night Court.\no I did indeed love this book so much. Feyre’s internal struggle just fractured my heart throughout the entire thing. Her spiraling into despair and Tamlin not noticing but Rhys noticing that she was coming to him during his weeks, frail and full of nothing was so amazing.\no Watching their characters develop a relationship was amazing. I understand why this book is the favorite of the ENTIRE series.",

        "comment": "** Warning: This is NOT a spoiler-free review like I usually write. I won’t give away twists from the very end but I WILL be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book! **\n\nI was pleasantly surprised when I read A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES last year because going into it, I knew it was a story with a strong fae presence. By this point in time in my reading career, I wasn’t new to fantasy but I was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy I liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themes… But knowing how much I loved Sarah’s Throne of Glass series and the fae presence there, I dove into ACOTAR and loved it! It had a bit of a BREAKING DAWN ending so I wasn’t quite sure where the second book would go but naturally I had very, very high hopes for it since I hadn’t been let down by a Maas book yet!\n\nI won’t sugar coat it — it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book. I was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and I just didn’t feel like things were moving forward. There was a lot of time spent on Feyre’s PTSD from her time Under the Mountain and I absolutely understand and don’t think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over. I do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though. ACOMAF isn’t a short book and I think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning. If the book were more character-based instead of plot-driven, it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isn’t the first time I felt this way in a Maas book either. I understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but I felt like I was reading about totally different characters when I started ACOMAF. Feyre and Tamlin were just not themselves and I think had ACOTAR ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout ACOMAF, it wouldn’t have been as much of a surprise. I just really felt like I was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to, especially since I had read ACOTAR over a year before I got to start ACOMAF.\n\nI continued to have issues with Feyre throughout the book. I don’t know why but she was just really bothering me. Instead of snarky, witty comebacks, I felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone. It was really hard to watch her interact with characters and I started to latch onto new (or new-to-the-spotlight) characters like Rhysand and his gang. It did make me extra thankful for Rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up, though! The interactions between Feyre and Tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read. Then I ended up on the flip side where although I didn’t want Feyre and Tamlin to still be together, I also felt really weird that Tamlin was almost totally absent from this book. He was there in the beginning and I won’t speak of the ending but this book was straight up about Feyre and Rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between Feyre and Tamlin in ACOTAR to have it totally change. I absolutely love where it went but it’s confusing to understand why the Feyre/Tamlin romance was so important and developed in ACOTAR and why Rhysand wasn’t more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the door.\n\nI’ve followed the romances in Sarah J. Maas’ books quite well, I think, considering they’re not always simple and straightforward. I know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their OTPs with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and I feel like I’ve followed along with that fairly easily. I can see where people feel like the romance in ACOMAF is a love triangle and I guess to a certain extent it is, but Feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time. It is quite complicated though so if you’re sensitive about triangles, you almost definitely won’t like the romance.\n\nI personally loved the development of Rhysand as a love interest, especially once Feyre really started to struggle with Tamlin. I found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives, Feyre and Tamlin drifted apart and just couldn’t find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together. That doesn’t always mean that you shouldn’t be with someone but in the case of story telling, it’s a pretty big sign that the main character isn’t where they should be. I’ve heard this complaint from other Maas readers but this is the first of her books where I really felt like the romance started to take over the book. While I did love the new Rhysand/Feyre development, I felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major (finally) happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive, similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story. Their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so it’s not like I wanted it to be downplayed but I just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy — and yes, there are some cheesy romance book-worthy moments. Let’s just say this is NOT A YOUNG ADULT BOOK, friends. There are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directing/teaching teens who are reading this series, you may not want to put this book directly into their hands. (Not that I’m saying censor them but. Ya know. Read it first so you know what you’re giving them.)\n\nThe sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful. Sarah J. Maas is still a master at layering stories and it’s so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book. There were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from ACOMAF and see from a different character’s perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper! Once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter, the book was simply addicting and I couldn’t wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going! Sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and it’s so fun to watch that develop. The ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why I had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book. So many things were revealed, actions taken, and trusts betrayed that I just really didn’t know what was coming. The twists and surprises were epic and once again, I was left in utter anticipation of the next book!",

    "synopsis": "Love is a sacrifice at the altar of power.\n\nIn the wake of the Kejari, everything Oraya once thought to be true has been destroyed. A prisoner in her own kingdom, grieving the only family she ever had, and reeling from a gutting betrayal, she no longer even knows the truth of her own blood. She’s left only with one certainty: she cannot trust anyone, least of all Raihn.\n\nThe House of Night, too, is surrounded by enemies. Raihn’s own nobles are none too eager to accept a Turned king, especially one who was once a slave. And the House of Blood digs their claws into the kingdom, threatening to tear it apart from the inside.\n\nWhen Raihn offers Oraya a secret alliance, taking the deal is her only chance at reclaiming her kingdom–and gaining her vengeance against the lover who betrayed her. But to do so, she’ll need to harness a devastating ancient power, intertwined with her father’s greatest secrets.\n\nBut with enemies closing in on all sides, nothing is as it seems. As she unravels her past and faces her future, Oraya finds herself forced to choose between the bloody reality of seizing power – and the devastating love that could be her downfall.\n\nFull of heartbreak, redemption, bloody intrigue, and heart-pounding action, The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King is the gutting second installment of the Crowns of Nyaxia series, and the conclusion of the Nightborn Duet – perfect for fans of From Blood and Ash and A Court of Thorns and Roses.",

        "comment": "*SPOILERS AHEAD! DON’T READ IF YOU HAVEN’T READ THE FIRST BOOK! CHECK TRIGGER WARNINGS!\n\n5⭐️/ 3-4🌶️\n\nThe continuation of Oraya and Raihn’s story! With the first book, “The Serpent and the Wings of Night” ending on such a dramatic cliffhanger, I was all but waiting to get my hands on the next book! Oraya found herself married to Raihn, the newly announced King of the House of Night after using his wish from the Kejari and brutally murdered Oraya’s father, the former King, Vincent. A lot of things were up in the air from trying to navigate and win over the nobles of the court, establishing Raihn’s new reign over the kingdom, politics, Oraya dealing with the grief and loss of her father, as well as finding out that she was now an Heir?! There was so much more with this book than I initially anticipated, and so excited to continue with my fantasy girl era adventures alongside Oraya and Raihn.\n\nThe last thing Oraya imagined was getting married, especially to her now again enemy, Raihn. In a way, it was a marriage of convenience since, with Oraya being married to Raihn, it proved protection for her against the Rishan or anyone else that wanted her dead. Oraya didn’t expect to see this coming with Raihn taking over the kingdom she grew up in, let only killing the only man who raised her. In other words, Oraya felt conflicted because, as much as she now despised Raihn, there was still that flicker of memories from their passionate night and moments they spent getting close to each other. Even Raihn, while presenting a facade of being the cruel and merciless king in front of others couldn’t stop himself from feeling protective over Oraya, as well as missing the way they use to be together.\n\nWith the second book starting, it was only a matter of time when the political intrigue would start to come out, especially in terms of Oraya deciding what she was going to do now that she was the Heir of the House of Night. For the longest time, even in the last book, Oraya felt like she didn’t fit in since she was human. Always having felt the need to be prepared for anything, making sure she could protect herself against the predators that surrounded her, Oraya was strong, but she wasn’t necessarily ready for the new tasks that would come with being an Heir. In the beginning, I was still questioning what it meant that Oraya was an Heir, and how Vincent may have left out some vital information on her background. Anyways, seeing Oraya decide to take part in fulfilling her duties as an Heir set off a new chain of events that I was questioning at every turn of what would happen next?!\n\nNow that this book was written in dual p.o.v. I was able to not only get Raihn’s perspective, but also get more background information on him. Right away in the beginning of this book, the story opened on essentially the ending of the last book and how the Kejari ended with Raihn making his wish. With Raihn having made his wish, he was now the King, married to Oraya (kind of political marriage/ of convenience), Raihn was ready to fulfill his duty of making the kingdom great again. Being a king wasn’t an easy task as most would imagine and for Raihn, he needed to show everyone that he should be feared and respected. Some moments Raihn would act a certain way in order to maintain control over his subject as well as shall I say, take inspiration from his former master in order to be cold and calculating. Seeing Raihn in this book made me see him in a new light in that similar to the cliffhanger of the first book, Raihn was willing to do what was necessary in order to secure his reign. Although, as much as Raihn portrayed himself to be this all mighty and powerful king, he still couldn’t deny his concerns and feelings towards Oraya.\n\nALSO PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ, “Six Scorched Roses” the novella before reading this book as the main characters from that novella reappeared in this book! So glad I read the novella because, I got to see Vale and Lilith again! Yay! Especially with the way the novella ended, I was pleasantly surprised by the way Lilith had integrated herself among Rainh’s court. Vale was still such a grump, but strongly protective of his WIFE, LILITH! I was curious to see how Vale and Lilith would be around the other characters and from their scenes in this book, I was excited to see more, but also how Vale and Lilith were just the sweetest together!\n\nMuch like the last book, there was build up in Oraya and Raihn’s romance, especially with the added tension, it created a much more satisfying affect. With Oraya and Raihn at odds based from the beginning of this book, you would think it was over between them, but nope! It definitely wasn’t over. Oraya and Raihn still cared for each other deeply as well as missed the passionate moments they once shared. One thing I absolutely loved about Raihn was the way he expressed his feelings for Oraya, the kind that got my eyes doing a double take and wishing Raihn would say that to me (sigh) absolute perfection!\n\"Let me make you the queen that you are. Let me guard your body, your soul, your heart. Let me spend the rest of my *bleep* pathetic life at your mercy. If I need to die, then let me do it by your hand. Please.\"\nEven in the middle of a spicy scene, Raihn was out there legitimately begging to have Oraya, but also managing to squeeze in a powerful quote that was beautiful and downright passionate! I essentially would love if Raihn quoted this to me word for word, I would happily take him for myself, thank you very much! The romantic quotes in this book were meaningful, beautiful, but even sprinkled with Raihn and Oraya’s reading ways to spice things up every now and then.\n\nThe plot twists, truth bombs, more secrets uncovered about both Raihn and Oraya’s lives, and more?! There was plenty to read about in this book that kept me turning page after page! From the betrayals, secrets, all out war, blood shed, and magic this story didn’t hold back whatsoever! Among the many things that occurred in this story, I was most perplexed by Oraya’s true nature and what it exactly meant for her to be a half vampire/human. For one, (from the first book and now this one) it was fully confirmed that Vincent was Oraya’s biological father, but then there was the question of… who was Oraya’s mom? Once it got closer to the end and the identity of who Oraya’s mom was, it actually made a lot more sense as to how she came to be a half vampire/human, but also how Vincent and Oraya’s mother met/ the significance of it all. So be prepared for lots of information to be thrown your way in this book, and your questions will all be answered. Meanwhile, in terms of Raihn’s past of being a former slave, this book definitely tackled that and gave more details as to how Raihn came to be the vampire he was. While the first book was heavily focused on Oraya, this book was equally about both her and Raihn, especially with the dual p.o.v. Raihn’s story became even stronger.\n\nOMG THIS WAS FANTASTIC! Oraya, my an absolute (and legit) Queen conquered the most death defying odds as well as Raihn managing to escape some close calls too! This was a brilliant end of Oraya and Raihn’s story! I truly wasn’t sure what to expect from this book, but with the amount of plot twists, truth bombs, action, romance, betrayals, secrets, magic, and more! It was an adventure filled ride to read for sure! I was so caught up in the world of this story that it seemed like time stood still and suddenly looking up from my book, I realized I was just along for the ride lol. Truly the kind of book you can escape to, and want to be part of all the action and drama that unfolded. Raihn and Oraya’s story revealed a lot of things about themselves and even their romance which was eye opening. Crazy to think how in this first book, it all started with a deadly competition, but the ending was just the tip of the iceberg that started the chain of events in this story. I truly adore both Oraya and Raihn, and I’m so impressed with the way they worked together, overcome so many obstacles, and their character growth was amazing. Carissa, on the off chance you are reading this review, I’m so thankful to have discovered your books, they have reinvigorated my love for fantasy books, and I will always love the characters from these books. Highly recommend you read this book, and essentially anything by Carissa as it will leave you on the edge of your seat, and immersed in a magical world that you haven’t read before!",

        "comment": "I loved this book so much. I can't put it into words. Simply PERFECTION. I see I have a pattern of having the second book of a series becoming my favorite book :))) and I can see why. \"The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King\" is my favorite book of this year so far.\n\nThis review contains some spoilers. For the ones that haven't read the first book but heard and read other reviews, my review might have spoilers.\n\nThis book broke my heart and restored and broke it again and patched it back up. The pace is perfect. It has a lot of action, A LOT (which is perfect for me). The world-building is intertwined with the plot twists and every time you find something new. The history of the characters is beautifully written, and every time you find something new about them, you get to understand them more (Vincent's actions for example).\n\nThe romance is perfect. I love Raihn and Oraya, and I think with the betrayal in the first book, they got a second chance in this one: to really know each other, to understand each other, and most importantly, to accept each other with their vulnerabilities, griefs, and past. To give themselves a second chance at happiness and to be willing to risk anything and everything for one another.\n\nI love Carissa's writing a lot, and the way she put the \"Interludes\" there is perfect. The way she created this world and the interactions between characters are perfect. I loved the side characters. Vale, Lilith, and Mische are my favorites from their inner circle. I would've loved to see more of them, but we got a full book for Vale and Lilith (Six Scorched Roses), and I have a feeling we will see more of Mische in future books/duologies.\n\nThe backstory of Vincent is just wow, and I'm so happy that, even if power was still a priority to him, he still gave himself a chance to feel something different, something that changes his heart. The moment he found Oraya, we get his perspective of how things went out, and what he felt in those moments is perfectly written. Maybe he didn't know how to show Oraya his love, but he damned well loved her, and I think he \"trapped\" her in her weaknesses because he was scared that one day he will lose her. And for his \"immortal\" life, the death of someone who allowed himself to love, will literally kill him and make him an even more dangerous thing to everyone. No matter what everyone will say about Vincent, good or bad, he made Oraya strong and gave her the tools to protect herself and believe in herself. He did love her and he showed her that in his own way.\n\nSeptimus is the same slime bastard, even worst. I didn't like Simon one bit, but the atrocities that Septimus did to him... literally turned him into a monster, a killing machine. I don't know about the next books, but I think Septimus will remain the worst of all the worst.\n\nI can't wait to see what Nyaxia will be preparing for them, but I think it will be ugly. I hope the other Gods will take their heads from their asses and do something other than nothing (something for the greater good, not something worse). The fighting scenes are incredibly written, and if for humans and vampires is this well written, I would love to see how the gods would fight.\n\nNow. I agree will all the readers of this book. CHAPTERS 44-45 killed me!!! Fans of ACOMAF, you better read this series and you will find yourselves another two chapters that will stick in your heads for eternity. The emotions and the passion in those chapters are perfect!!!! For me, chapter 63 is also a killer. No boundaries, no regrets, only pure love, and everything was written on their faces, on their bodies, on their movements, in their eyes. I actually think I love this chapter more than 44-45 because they let down their guards, even if they aren't saying the words. The emotions are much bigger than the words.\n\nAlso, the history of Oraya's mother is heartbreaking. I really wished that she somehow survived, but if this was the case, Oraya would've been too distract by the situation they were in.\n\nEVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED FROM CHAPTER 74 AND ON KILLED ME!!!! I screamed and cried and cursed Nyaxia and then cried again and then screamed for happiness. This whole book is a masterpiece and a rollercoaster. From the first page till the last. Everything is perfect.\n\nThank you Carissa for creating this amazing world. I can't wait to see what's coming next.",

        "comment": "I loved every moment in this book. I was worried that after A Court of Mist and Fury that the rest of the series would not hold up. While ACOMAF is my favorite so far AOWAR definitely held it own.\n\nI love all the new characters that we got to meet in this book along with all the new relationships.\n\nI love the connection between all the high lords. We get to see a lot more of their history and the relationships that they all had prior to the current timeline.\n\nMany secrets were reveled in this book... or more so truths that have not yet been told.\n\nMor and her secret that now only Feyre knows. I love this direction for her but I also am sadden for the relationship I was hoping for, for her and Azriel. I hope that in the future books we get to see more of their friendship. I hope they will both have new love interest in the future books.\nHerion and Lucian... Father and son. I Hope this is something that gets brought up again in the net book.\n\nThe relationships that still have so much questioning and I cannot wait to see what happens.\n\nObviously my favorite is Feyre and Rhys. Enough said.\n\nCassian and Nesta. Are they mates? Not mate? WHAT? I need more. I need to know! There is something more there and I cannot wait to read more to find out.\n\nAmern and Varian. I just need more of these two. I love the little bits that we got in this book.\n\nLucian and Elain. We know they are mates. Elain is still in love with her human ex fiancé Greyson. Ew. I love how gentle and understanding Lucian is and backs away when she needs him too.\n\nALL THE TWIST AT THE END!\n\n3 that got me the most!\n\n1. Feyre, Nesta and Elain's father. I was in tears!\n\"He calls himself the Prince of Merchants\"\n“He told me he's got three daughters who live here. And that he failed them for many years. But he would not fail them this time.\"\nThe ships at the front of the human armada became clear, along with the gold lettering on their sides. \"He named his three personal ships after them,\" Drakon said with a smile. And there, sailing at the front...I beheld the names of those ships.\nThe Feyre.\nThe Elain\nAnd leading the charge against Hybern, flying over the waves, unyielding and without an ounce of fear…\nThe Nesta\nWith my father…our father at the helm.\n\nI love this for these three so much. I completely forgot about their father and kind of just wrote him off. Then out of nowhere he has been battling and rallying for his girls. He didn’t know they were fae and was right in the middle of everything happening but he knew they were there and need help. I am sad that the King of Hybern killed their father. I would have really like to see more of his thoughts on becoming them becoming fae and what happened to them in his absence.\n\n2. Amren’s betraying/ not betraying Feyre. Let me tell ya I was so mad for a hot minute. I had to put the book down. I could not believe what was happening. I was thinking no way Amren is on the wrong side of this. She has helped and done so much. Then the twist.\n\nThe Suriel left the message to Feyre for Amren. For Amren to release her true self so that she alone can defeat Hyberns army. The begging from both Feyre and Varian for Amren not to release her true self because she would not remember them. She would not be able to return. But she is able to come back but she now is different.\n\nShe looked to Varian, a wry smile on her red mouth. “I watched them most—the humans who loved. I never understood it—how it happened. Why it happened.” She paused a step away from the Cauldron. “I think I might have learned with you, though. Perhaps that was a last gift, too.” Varian’s face twisted with anguish. But he made no further move to stop her. She turned to me. And spoke the words into my head—the spell I must think and feel and do. I nodded. “When I am free,” Amren said to us, “do not run. It will attract my attention.” She lifted a steady hand toward my arm.“I am glad we met, Feyre.” I smiled at her, bowing my head. “Me too, Amren. Me too.” Amren grabbed my wrist. And swung herself into the Cauldron\n\n3. Rhys dying. I did not see this coming! I have never had a book where one of my favorite characters dies. Or a main character die. I normally love the smaller characters more. Call me cheesy but I love, love. When he died and once Feyre noticed what had happened, my gut wrenched.\n\nRhys was sprawled on the rocky ground, wings draped behind him. He looked like he was sleeping. But as I breathed in— it wasn’t there. That thing that rose and fell with each breath. That echoed each heartbeat. The mating bond. It wasn’t there. It was gone. Because his own chest … it was not moving. And Rhys was dead.\n\nThe after math of this was just a much heart wrenching, maybe even worse. Feyre begging everyone to help Rhys and just when you think no one can help him. Feyre asks the high lords to bring him back like they did her. They need them all to do it, even Tamlin. Feyre says she would",

        "comment": "o This is the climax of the series as far as I am concerned. This book gets a lot of hate, but it is honestly, my favorite book of the series.\no OVERVIEW: SPOILERS: I have NEVER in my life had so many feelings about a man in my real life let alone in a book. I lost count how many times I closed this book and just shook the crap out of it because Tamlin made me so mad. GOOD LORD MAN. This dang book had me so in my feelings about everything every single time I turned the page.\no This is the climax of the Night Court story itself, the war with Hybern and trying to save the Fae Lands and the Courts. Hybern makes a deal with Tamlin and they bring the Night Court to his court and drag in Feyre’s human sisters, forcing them into the Cauldron to become made. But what they don’t know is that Nesta, ever the fighter, took from the cauldron just as it was taking from her and her sister. Which was when the Human Queens (part of the treaty) see that Hybern promised immortality from the cauldron with the sisters as tests, run but something was taken from Cauldron so it takes from the next one in the Cauldron, therefore making the Queens mad. War comes, Nesta saves Cassian twice, Hybern kills the girls’ father and Elain stabs him but Nesta has the killshot and removes his head, the girls’ father shows up with an armada when Drakon and Myriam show up with boats named after the girls, the cauldron calls Elain and they search for her. Feyre and Amren and Varian find the Cauldron but Amren deceives Feyre and dives into the Cauldron, she becomes her true form and wipes out mostly everything in the war with fire. The Cauldron explodes into three pieces and Rhys and Feyre save it by mending it back together because Feyre remembers that all life comes from the Cauldron, but when she comes back to reality, Rhys is lying on the ground and not breathing. She begs the high lords to fix him like they did her, so they do and he comes back.\no Along the way, Feyre faces fears that the Bone Carver told her about to free him to get him to fight with them against Hybern, also faces Bryaxis (the dark thing in the lowest level of the library where the Priestesses work at the House of Wind). Rhys frees the Weaver of the Wood (Bone Carvers sister) to help as well. Hybern kills the Bone Carver and the Weaver of the Wood and Bryaxis is still missing at the end of the book.\no There is just so freaking much that happens in this book and that is why it is my favorite. The weaving of stories is immaculate within this book. I know that quite a few people don’t like Sarah J. Mass’ writing but I did for sure. I’m also new to the Fae writing, etc. However, I did definitely like this one the best out of all of them and I would re-read it 2942359798 times if I could. The ending and beginning of stories throughout this is just one that I wish I could read for the first time again.",

The twists and turns, the moments where I was literally holding my breath. The parts where I literally BAWLED and was screaming NO.\n\nThis book traumatized me but in a good way. This book deserves an infinite amount of stars. I loved how it made me forget I was reading. Thats why I read. I read to go into these fantasy worlds and SJM does that. She does exactly that! Every time. I swear lol. There was many days where i stayed up till 2 am to finish a chapter …. Or maybe 6 lol. I cried, I mourned, I laughed, I was gasping and screaming.\n\nFav quotes:\n“It already ended badly. Now its just a matter of deciding how we meet the consequences.”\n\n“Leave this world a better place than how you found it.”\n\n“You do not fear. You do not falter. You do not yield. You go in, you get her, and you come back out again.”\n\n“Remember that you are a wolf. And you cannot be caged.”\n\n“If I end my life defending those who need it most, then i will consider it a death well spent.”\n\n“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”\n\n“I have no regrets in my life, but this. That we did not have time. That I did not have time with you, Nesta.”\n\nI love this book 😭🩷. SJM’s writing is addictive. The only thing I wished we could’ve seen more was Feyre in battle with her powers. She’s so powerful shes basically a walking weapon. But other than that i loved it 🩷",

    "synopsis": "Risk everything for your kingdom…\nOr be destroyed by it.\n\n\nIn a world darkened by deceit, the truth is a light that won’t be dimmed. Even when it illuminates Lorian’s betrayals more starkly than I could ever want to see.\n\nThey call him the Bloodthirsty Prince.\n\nHis reign of terror has left a trail of blood across this continent. A trail that intertwines with my own past–not even my parents were spared from his merciless slaughter.\n\nTo save my brother’s life, I agreed to another bargain with the fae prince. Now, I’m forced to work with him. Forced to travel to the fae lands. Forced to spend my every waking moment with the man who betrayed me. All because King Sabium has woven a deadly tapestry of manipulation, using those we least suspect for his wicked schemes.\n\nThere are no lines I won’t cross to protect the people I love. So I’ll work with former enemies. I’ll manipulate, blackmail, and deceive potential allies. I’ll swallow my pride, bury my shattered heart, and cooperate with the fae to prepare for the coming war.\n\nBecause there are creatures far more monstrous than the fae.\n\nAnd some of them masquerade as men.\n\nFor fantasy romance readers who love Raven Kennedy, Amanda Bouchet, and Carissa Broadbent. This slow burn, enemies-to-lovers series will enchant you.",

        "comment": "Can I first say that I loved this book with everything in me. Battles, romance, plots, and spies, and everything else in between.\n\nThis is the second book in the Kingdom of Lies series, and it does not disappoint! Each page kept me on the edge, wanting more of... well, everything! We learn more backstory of several characters this time, which I had been hoping for. We also get more lovely steamy scenes to satisfy the romantics.\n\nA Kingdom This Cursed and Empty takes off where the first book ended, with Prisca and Lorian continuing their journey together. If you have not read the first book, A Court This Cruel and Lovely, I'd highly recommend you read it first, things just won't make much sense otherwise. I love that Stacia's writing doesn't give the audience pages of 'recaps of book 1' that so many other series offer. The continuation of this second book flows well and doesn't need the constant reminders of previous events. When she does reference occurrences from her first book, it flows naturally and makes sense in the scene.\n\nTowards the end, I did have my suspicions of where this was going, and I was both proud of myself and saddened when I learned those suspicions were correct. She gives you just enough hints to figure it out on your own mere pages before the reveal.\n\nAnd now I am here just existing until the third volume comes out. A hole in my heart that only her next book can fill.",

This book continue with Prisca and her story, I so enjoyed how Prisca envolved during her journey. The constant obstacles thrown at her and how she picked herself up and continue fighting was fantastic. Lorian and Prisca finally admit to themselves about their love to eachother and while for sure it was a lot of romance, it was also the story itself that kept me hooked. I love a strong FMC that fights for what she thinks is right, and Prisca very much fulfills this, of course with a possesive MMC such as Lorian that supports her and always puts her first. This book has a strong story and the world building is awesome, my only problem is that i now have to wait for the next book.",

There are a few back stories filled in, we get to understand the complexity of the main characters, thier history's that shaped them and we get to meet Lorians brother. Lots of angst, conspiring, corruptions, spice, potential side stories. It's what you would expect people with power to behave like.\n\nThe love story between prisca and Lorian is almost tragic. We learn things in this book that I suspected to be true so it was nice to have confirmation 👍 now we wait till prisca realises it too! They are perfect as mmc/mfm. The spice is a solid 3 😁 👌 it's not overly graphic which is good but the scenes are more often, not complaining at all. They can't stay away from each other and I love that. No matter who is trying to keep them apart they find a way back! The fates have plans!\n\nI love all the side characters they all have a part to play and are on thier own journeys, it absolutely adds to the story rather than distract you or go's off on a tangent leaving you confused 😁👍I'm excited to see what part they play in Priscas journey to being the heir to the hybrid throne!\n\nIt ends on a cliffhanger, I absolutely did not expect it. Stacia really knows how to rip your heart out ❤️ so be aware. Can't wait for the next book now 😍 🤗 ☺️.\n\nI received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review.",

        "comment": "Sequel Does NOT Disappoint. I literally had a hard time putting my phone away when I needed to study for my finals and board exam -- and I'm not talking about undergrad college finals but graduate level finals t.t If you haven't read book 1, A Court this Cruel and Lovely, I suggest you go pick up a copy first before reading this.\n\nPlot - 4.5 stars\nStory picks up right after the ending of book 1. Prisca is heartbroken/mad at Lorian, which makes sense, BUT it didn't take her the entire book to accept her feelings for him. And yes this has the trope of he falls first/admits first.\nI really like how there is a \"training arc.\" The hybrids didn't automatically became OP after leaving the prison. There's a lot of monologues from Prisca but I was okay with it bc it partially explains the court scheming/politics she had to do. Some characters were introduced/brought back from book 1 and it kind of made the plot predictable, but it helps with character developments from the main cast. OKAY so the ending... The ending got me in a chokehold. I had to double check if this was actually the last page, I hadn't got hit from a good cliffhanger in so long. Thank goodness the next book is out in November.\n\nSpice - 5 stars\nI thought the spice was all tactfully placed, like it made sense. There's not an overwhelming amount of spice, but when it happens, oooh it's spicy.\n\nOverall, maybe because I'm a sucker for the chosen/unchosen one trope and people taking back their kingdom (TOG <3 IYKYK), but I thoroughly enjoy this book. I would 100% buy a physical copy, reread, and look for Stacia at conventions to sign my book.\n\nI received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review.",

The second year is when the rest of us lose our humanity.” —Xaden Riorson\n\nEveryone expected Violet Sorrengail to die during her first year at Basgiath War College—Violet included. But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky.\n\nNow the real training begins, and Violet’s already wondering how she’ll get through. It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance. It’s the new vice commandant, who’s made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is–unless she betrays the man she loves.\n\nAlthough Violet’s body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else’s, she still has her wits—and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules.\n\nBut a determination to survive won’t be enough this year.\n\nBecause Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College—and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.\n\nThe Empyrean series is best enjoyed in order.\nReading Order:\nBook #1 Fourth Wing\nBook #2 Iron Flame",

        "comment": "A Court of Frost and Starlight was exactly what it was advertised as: a fun, short, and festive novella about the Inner Circle celebrating the Winter Solstice and Feyre’s birthday. Besides the festivities, we get to see the characters rebuilding Prythian and supporting each other in the aftermath of the war. This book is everything that I was expecting and more. I specifically saved it to read during the winter, instead of when it published, like everyone else. I’m glad I made that decision because I can imagine Velaris during the holidays so vividly while experiencing the cold weather myself. ACOFAS is a lovely, sweet, and lighthearted story with holiday cheer. However, it still has a dark, melancholy feel to it because of the scars that the war left in its wake. It warms my heart to read about the Court of Dreams feeling happy, festive, relaxed, and peaceful. After the distress and heartache in ACOWAR, they deserved to have a happy holiday. Especially since every character is still dealing with the impact. It’s awesome to have new content about my favorite characters, even if it’s just a novella. I would’ve been disappointed if Feyre’s narrative finished with ACOWAR. It was a good ending but it was too open for me to be completely satisfied with it. I love ACOFAS so much and I’m so happy that Sarah J. Maas wrote this book!!\n\n——-\n\nBelow, I mention what I love and dislike about ACOFAS, with specific spoilers and concluding thoughts. If you haven’t read ACOFAS and don’t want to be spoiled, do NOT read past this. If you want to be spoiled so you can decide to read this book, then be my guest. If you have read ACOFAS and are interested in hearing my opinions, then go ahead. Overall, thank you for reading my review!!\n\n______\n\nWhat I loved about ACOFAS:\n- The Inner Circle doing normal, fun things like shopping!! This isn’t something that’s seen often in a Fantasy world.\n- Multiple points of view!!! I enjoy reading books like this. Especially when there’s a large number of characters that I love. I want to know everyone’s thinking!! I think books written this way are more open minded, instead of viewing everything from one perspective.\n- CHAPTER 13. Feyre goes shopping with Elain in a weaver’s shop and asks about a tapestry. The weavers response about her grief and needing to create is powerful. This scene was so emotionally moving for me. I reacted the same way as Feyre while reading the chapter!!\n- Feyre beginning to paint again!! Also, her feeling weaver’s words in her heart and soul. I always love when characters have artistic hobbies. It was really motivating to see Feyre remember the Suriel and using those last words to make a change in Velaris. Feyre and Ressina (side character) starting free art therapy classes for children and parents was so inspiring!! I really enjoyed Feyre’s character in this book. The theme of using art to express emotions/trauma and to heal is the best part of this story!!\n- NESTA. I loved her character in ACOWAR and she was fabulous in that book. Although it was short, I’m glad that we got to read in her view. Nesta admitting that she feels nothing is sad, depressing, and concerning. I still love her character though. I like that Nesta has found somewhat of a friend in Amren. I strongly believe that Nesta deserves a happy ending! Yes, I’m extremely excited about the Nesta and Cassian spin-off book!!!\n- AMREN. She’s hilarious and such an entertaining character. Her reactions to the gifts she received is amazing. I love what Amren said about Nesta. I share the same thoughts about her. We got to see more of Amren & Varian, which I enjoyed.\n- ELAIN. She’s has a cute, kind, and gentle personality. It was nice to see her recovery from ACOWAR and busying herself with helping Nuala & Cerridwen. I can personally relate to Elain a lot in this book.\n- Feyre and Rhysand are relationship goals!! It’s so endearing the way that these cuties love and support each other through everything. I think everyone deserves a relationship like Rhys & Feyre!\n- The snowball fight Solstice tradition that Rhysand, Cassian, and Azriel do at the cabin. This Illyrian bat trio is so adorable!!\n- Rhysand, Feyre, Amren, Mor, Cassian, Azriel, Elain, even Nesta and Varian spending time together!! The Court of Dreams laughter and giving gifts. I live for the banter between them!! They are my favorite fictional group characters and ACOFAS made me love the Inner Circle even more.\n\n———-\n\nWhat I didn’t like about ACOFAS:\n- The wall scene. I wasn’t excited about it and I don’t care about this scene at all. I didn’t mind these scenes in the other books because they full length. It bothered me in ACOFAS because the book is shorter than the others. I’m over Maas sex scenes now though. Honestly, I would’ve preferred Azriel or Elain to get a chapter in their point of view than a full chapter about Feyre & Rhys making love (in such a short book).\n- Rhys going to the Spring Court and saying those negative things to Tamlin. I understand that Tamlin can’t be forgiven for his actions, but Rhysand’s words were unnecessary. As Lucien said: “Your mate should’ve known better than to kick a downed male” (page 165). However, I was relieved to see that Rhysand was self aware and knew he behaved poorly.\n- Elain and Azriel being the only two without a chapters in their points of view. I love their characters and I personally relate to them for different reasons. I really hope Sarah writes a spin-off book or novella to make up for this!!\nThese dislikes are why I gave ACOFAS four stars instead of five.\n———\n\nACOFAS didn’t really have much of a plot which I was completely fine with!! I was anticipating this because it’s just a novella to update us on the characters before the spin-off novels. For this reason, I can somewhat understand why the general consensus about ACOFAS is that it’s disappointing. Especially since most people in the book reading world read Fantasy books. ACOFAS is much more character oriented and not plot friendly. As I said above, I think this is something that’s not usually seen in a book set in a Fantasy world. I primarily read YA Contemporary books, so I’m accustomed to reading character oriented stories. ACOFAS didn’t disappoint me at all! What disappoints me is the mixed and negative comments about it. I wasn’t expecting so many low reviews for a Sarah J. Maas book because most of them well received. As usual, I have an unpopular opinion about a Sarah J. Maas book or character(s)!! In conclusion, I throughly enjoyed reading A Court of Frost of Starlight. I think it’s a wonderful, amazing, and positive story that’s worth reading, especially if you’re like me: a die hard ACOTAR fan. This book is now one of my favorites!!",

        "comment": "Another great addition to the story and this world! - Sorry this is long and thoughts are random.\nFirst, I have to say if you went into this novella thinking it was going to be a serious plot and similar to the books then I can totally understand the negative review. But SJM did say this was her fangirling her own work! I honestly liked the light-heartedness and no-anxiety events and just wanted to live with these characters a little longer. So, with that being said here are all my thoughts I had to get on paper after reading and sorry but there may be some *spoilers*\n\nACOFAS really showed how much SJM loves these characters!\nIt was so nice to get to live with these characters and see them interact and live without the stress and anxiety of impeding terror, war, conflict or just the angst and impeding “will they/won’t they” of love.\nEven though it was a novella I am grateful we got another book from not only Feyre’s POV but Rhys, Nesta, Mor and Cassian’s as well. This made it especially wonderful to get into their heads and a nice segway into the next set of books.\nI like the path Elain is starting to head down – she seems to have accepted her situation and trying to live this new life. I’m also liking this possibility of Elain and Az becoming an item with their little interactions and flirting. This also lent to some very funny situations in the book during Solstice. As much as I love Lucien, I like the idea of Elain not settling for her mate at face value and doing her own thing. Though part of me is kind of not thrilled with all 3 sisters being with the Illyrians. But I think Lucien is more suited for Vassa, in my opinion.\nTamlin – My perspective of Tamlin has changed. After ACOWAR was released I took a step back from this whole, read a bunch of books and really distanced myself knowing this novella was coming out in May. I wanted to reread the whole series trying to recreate reading for the first time and honestly this time around I saw Tamlin in a different light. Don’t get me wrong, I think Tamlin did some really horrible things and I’m interested to see where he goes from here after reading ACOFAS, but I feel bad for the guy now. Loved he got what he deserved but in the same breath I hate that is had to get so bad for him too FINALLY realize what he had done. This guys just can’t get a handle on doing things without going to the extremes. Also, I need to give my boy, Rhys, a high five for finally saying what he did but also to go back and be the better person and almost apologize. Tamlin is a flawed character I think by circumstance, he is prideful, set in the old ways (though he says he wants change) and even though he tried to do what he thought was right. I think he cared too much and just didn’t have the right people around him to guide and advise. Rhys has mentioned prior that if it wasn’t for Amren, Mor, As & Cassian he could have turned out just like his father but he had a circle of friends that weren’t afraid of him. Tamlin truly never learned how to properly communicate, he let his beast rule on action & emotion and that was very evident on how he treated Feyre and would react to situations. I’ll be curious to see how his situation and actions evolve in the next books.\n\nParts of this book had me out right bursting with laughter! Can’t believe I’m saying this but I don’t think I can love Rhys more – this book was amazing to see him without the mask – he is such a dork! Loved the cocky, snarky banter and sarcasm along with his undying love/affection for Feyre. Also, how the Inner Circle was just as sarcastic and open right back at him. So sad this could be the last from his POV. I was left in a good place with Feyre – it was nice to see her struggle and journey to healing. I feel she never really had much time to do anything with all the events of the previous books. Not only with healing herself but her ability to recognized and see that there are others that she could help by sharing her story and using her artwork. I liked that in the end she’s more open and accepting of herself and title, is now happy. Fingers crossed for baby Feysand!\nNesta – Not sure I’m 100% with her. Too many questions here and love that Cassian is going to keep trying to push her. The next book should be interesting! I just feel like Nesta needs to get her head out of her butt and is just being too much of a b-word. I totally understand she had some tramatic stuff happen to her but Feyre and Elain did as well, you can even pull Mor and Az into that has other people have suffered at the hands of others and they are all able to lean on each other and learn to cope, accept, hope, dream and laugh and I feel Nesta is just needing to stop being so prideful and admit she needs helps. She doesn’t even need to openly say “I need help” just be around the people that want to help her and live life. We shall see…..\n\nSuch a great way to bring together Feyre & Rhys’s story to show you can truly survive, find love and laughter after experiencing such darkness, torment, abuse and loneliness. I love how we got to see these characters rise above and desire such hope for the future after such trials. Not to let themselves be victims, broken and drown in it (like Tamlin’s doing) but to use it as strength. Lean on family/friends – give space when needed, but knowing when and how to push. Such great strong messages in such an amazing series.\n• Not sure I like no more townhouse ☹\n• Wall scene! Rhys’s chapter after was so great!\n• Finally know where the clothes came from!\nLoved how SJM snuck in answers to some of the random thoughts and questions sprinkled throughout the books and added in some new characters. I did kind of want Mor to say she was leaving to join the Winter Court, though still curious to see what she will be up too.\nNew unanswered questions\n1. What are Keir and Eris up too\n2. Are we going to see anymore of Miryam and Drakon or are they gone again\n3. What’s going on with the “Band of Exiles” / The Mortal Queens / Vassa’s curse – could there be another conflict on the rise\n4. Bryaxis",

Maas's sexy, richly imagined series continues with the journey of Feyre's fiery sister, Nesta.\n\nNesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.\n\nThe one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.\n\nMeanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.\n\nAgainst the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.",

        "comment": "I have read every single book SJM has ever released, and even read the bit of the Starkillers Cycle that she published. I had my mom buy the first TOG book when it had just released and I was 15 or 16. So when I say I am a fan, I mean it. I have defended Sarah J. Maas, through rough Tumblr years, and indignantly scrolled through Goodreads, annoyed that the people who disliked her just wouldn't leave the fans alone.\n\nThat said, I'm not blind to some of the weaknesses I've read. Some of her books are better than others, and the representation has been missing, lacking, or seemingly shoehorned in, at times. But, I would say, she is improving, at least. Which makes this review a bit difficult for me to write. There are three categories that stuck out to me as bothersome: the themes, characterization, and the pacing. (Spoilers below).\n\n1) The Themes\nIn this book, Nesta Archeron has to atone for the horrible things she has said and done, while overcoming the bad things said and done to her. All this, while facing an external threat from the eastern continent. At least, that's what the audience is told. I wish this had been how the book played out. But, what I thought was something done in her books once, was not an anomaly. Something reared its head again as an unwelcome pattern: retconning, and this time, to the story's detriment. Instead of Nesta having done bad things or been a bad person, she'd merely been misunderstood. So many of Maas' characters aren't truly bad, but *misunderstood*. This works once or twice, but in Nesta's book, this shouldn't have been in here, because it works against the book's favor, badly. Why?\nBecause even if Nesta Archeron herself was never actually bad, then what hope do the audience have of connecting with Maas' characters? Everyone has done and said things they regretted. In reality, most people probably could have related to Nesta's flaws more than Feyre's. Nesta was a pride-filled coward, which she knew and understood, making her hate herself, and then that hate spools from her to the people around her. She was too much of a coward to keep the family alive and hunt, as Feyre had done, too much of a coward to save her sister from Tamlin, too much of a coward to step in on behalf of her father. Again and again and again. But Feyre? She was never a coward, and she found love and acceptance much easier than Nesta ever did; in a way, Nesta's dislike and envy of Feyre are understandable (though hopefully not relatable). Feyre is the perfect, adored sister, and Nesta is the sullen child nobody notices, or outright dislikes. Nesta is Feyre's dark mirror; every choice Nesta chose not to make (overcoming anger, willing herself into action to help the family survive), Feyre chose the opposite and became what Nesta could have become, had Nesta made different choices. And Nesta's words and actions could then be interpreted as a guard against this because she understands and welcomes their dislike of her.\n\nNesta is proud, and controlling. If she only shows people the parts of her that she doesn't really see as herself, then she never runs the risk of being hurt. And, as many people know well the feeling, sometimes families can typecast a person for something that would otherwise be a phase, so even when a person tries to grow out of it, their families only ever see them as the person they were, instead of the person they are trying to become. This is inferred through the third person, though as much of this book deals with internal conflict, I kept wondering why it wasn't in the first person. Especially since much of the story has to deal with Nesta overcoming much of her thought processes and feelings. And Nesta's feelings towards Feyre came across as ill-defined and inexplicable. That theme of jealousy was hinted at here and there, but never fully explored, or realized for what it was (self-hatred). Again, so much of this book would have made a thousand times more sense if done in the first person.\n\nKeeping in mind all these flaws, its important to note that most of Nesta's flaws are rationalized away. This is a pity, as this could have been distinguished as a story of redemption, as opposed to a story very similar to Feyre's in dealing with PTSD. One of the big things with redemption, and this is VERY important to understand, not only about characters, but people at large; people WANT to have consequences for awful actions. There's a scene in Breaking Bad where Aaron Paul's character goes to group therapy and tells everyone that he killed a dog for no reason. The therapist tells him that its okay, to accept it, and move on. Forgive. But Paul's character is enraged at this; he wants there to be consequences and he wants people to be disgusted by his actions. This is because, even when people stray from their morals, they want that moral compass to remain, because without it, there's nothing to pull them back. There is no reason to try in society, if there is no guiding principles to work towards. And if there's no consequences, what's to stop the other monsters from getting them?\n\nI've never been at a point like Paul's character, where I did something like that, but I have said and done things I regretted. And when I confided in them to other people, I did not want their absolution. I wanted their reassurance that atonement was possible, and that redemption is possible. That it is possible to be at a point that is bad, but have a path leading out of that darkness.\n\nSo, when Nesta complains that she didn't save her father, its weakened by the fact that she *couldn't* save her father, despite her wanting to, as she didn't know how. I understand that type of guilt, but its also a blameless guilt. Unfounded. Ultimately, her actions were rationally and logically guiltless. Just as Feyre killed those faeries in ACOTAR in order to save Prythian, Nesta's guilt has a silver lining because there was a justification for Nesta to ultimately not blame herself. And there's a big moment when Nesta learns to stop blaming herself for something that's not her fault. Retreading familiar territory. What if Nesta had done something that was her fault, something horrible, and something she deserved blame for? That's new and different territory. Those moments of self-hatred and self-acceptance would have been so much more powerful, if the hate Nesta had in her heart for so many years, made her hesitate to save her father, despite knowing how to save him. It would have been more consistent with her character. Finding a road to redemption is much more relatable than finding a way to forgive oneself over something that wasn't really even Nesta's fault. Overcoming blameless guilt is a story beat that's becoming repetitive in Maas's works.\n\n(minor gripe here as well: as someone who has lived in poverty, and has known people who have lived in absolute poverty, I didn't really connect well with how Nesta grapples with that past. Its not just, oh I was starving and that was traumatic. There's this whole mentality and safeguards and all sorts of things. In particular, I felt it would be more suiting for Nesta if she rejected conspicuous consumption and harbored a bit of resentment at the Night Court for having so much, while others have so little. It is, after all, well-established that she reads a lot. As Prythian has a technically longer written word history than the planet earth, it stands to reason, she would have encountered differing philosophies and politics regarding this, especially as she was so affected by it.)\n\n2) The Characterization\nOne of the nice things about ACOMAF is that when the Night Court is introduced, all the characters have such distinct personalities. Unfortunately, that is not as apparent in this book. Cassian's personality is vague. He's a tough guy who's insecure about being thought of as a brute? Not really a personality. I found his perspective to really drag. In ACOMAF, I kind of saw him as this sort of Himbo, that's warm, kind, and funny. Not a bit of evil cunning, but only because he has a charming sincerity to him, and is loyal as all get out. So him, being all torn up inside about not being cruel enough, is off-putting. When he is capable of coming up with insults for someone else enough to make them feel bad about themselves, this is upheld as a good thing.\n\nHis characterization is vague, and so is Mor's, who as the only person openly LGBT in this book, spent the majority of the book, not in the story or at the Night Court. Its also important to note that Nesta could have easily been written as bisexual, but this was not done, even though representation is sorely lacking.\n\nAnd, in keeping with a more consistent take on the character, and a more realistic arc, Nesta's cruel words could have been honed to softer truths. After all, much of what she says, though blunt and tactless, is her being honest when no one else is. This would have kept consistency with her character, as she learns how to navigate kind honesty (that people need to face) and vulnerability, instead of just vulnerability or a type of angry reaction.\n\n3) The Pacing\nThis book had spots that were very much unnecessary. In fact, Cassian's perspective wasn't really necessary at all. And the SEX! There's just... so much of it. SO MUCH. And I read romance books, but this just had a distracting amount of it. Parts of it did not serve the plot or the characters well, or seemed just awkward.\n\nSo many times, I felt as if Maas had to throw in a, \"someone gasped,\" \"he gaped,\" etc. And it didn't really feel earned, or genuine. Instead of letting the audience know that Nesta entranced the crowd as she danced, Maas has some over-the-top descriptions about world-shattering adjacent, gasp-inducing, etc. etc. Not every moment that is profound to the characters has to be profound to the audience around them. It felt misplaced and distracting. And here's where my headline comes in: does SJM have a new editor? Because some of the choices made in this book veered from what SJM has done. A good editor could have gone in and gently guided some of these excesses away. Even the choice to use words like \"smut\" or \"Valkyrie\" was strange. So much of the world to that point had used original wording, but why couldn't the Valkyries have their own unique name, such as the Illyrians?\n\nThis is kind of a rambling mess. Its just, as an invested fan, I hope this isn't the direction all of SJM's books will go in. This felt like a downgrade. And I feel kind of bad saying that because she spoke in the acknowledgments about how much she related to this book, and how she was dealing with a mental health crisis while writing it. I felt that Feyre's book grappled with many of these issues in a more genuine manner that was consistent with her character. And really, that's what this whole criticism boils down to: a lack of consistency, in themes, characters, and pacing for A Court of Silver Flames.\n\nI am eager to read Crescent City's sequel, and can kind of see a potential team-up novel she might do in the future, where a sort of threat emerges to the multiverse, so her various protagonists team up to fight against it. Fingers crossed for now, but my expectation is tempered.",

        "comment": "Wow...I mean yeah, lots of tears whilst reading through this one. I didn't think anything could move me as much as Feyre x Rhys's love for each other, but Nesta's journey with Gwyn and Emerie (her chosen family, her Valkyrie) is definitely up there. Nesta's transformation, from how we meet her to how we leave her, made me so emotional. Her character development did leave me wanting at some points (reasons explained later), but the foundations for her story were laid out so well in the previous books that by the time I got through the first few chapters of ACOSF, I got from really disinterested to \"GET OUT THE WAY RHYS-FEYRE\". Truly, major props to SJM for getting me to invest as much as I did considering my initial feelings towards Cassian and Nesta\n\nI agree with most of the criticism already said here--\n-- that Cass's character development didn't seem particularly memorable or special to him (though his history with his brothers and his their Illyrian beginnings are beautiful). Even the parts about his mother and how that inspires his advocacy for female Illyrian warriors could've been fleshed out more.\n-- Nesta's flaws and traumas being rationalized away was jarring at many points. Sure there's only so much you can flesh out, but some key moments-- like when she and her friends hash out their traumas during the Blood Rite--have this abrupt resolution that wraps up Nesta's months of recovery in a nice little bow. It made her overall character development a little shallow and lended itself to hitting an ending plot point rather than a natural progression. And I think this also robs Nesta of what could've beautifully distinguished her from Feyre, because somehow Feyre's and Nesta's journey end up being more or less the same.\n-- It's a lot of sex. Not complaining! But I did feel it edging towards excessive for a few moments. And maybe more so because I didn't feel like it served the story or characters. Her personality doesn't seem naturally inclined her to be more sex driven than Feyre. I understand her reasons (numbing trauma), but how SJM writes the sex scenes with Cassian, even after their feelings are mutually acknowledged, don't feel that special to me because it doesn't reveal as much internal development.\n\nOne personal gripe is the repetitive nature of SJM's writing--overusing character descriptions, overusing certain words, and the numerous dependent clauses. Most of the characters end up sounding and speaking the same which annoyed me a bit\n\nBut overall, I still stand by this addition to the series and I can't wait to read more! I'm sooo hungry for more on (SPOILER) what's below the Illyrian Mountains, how the ensuing conflict with the other queens will go, and Nesta's change in powers. I'm betting that the next book is an Elain spin-off because SJM definitely planted a few seeds in Elain's story (and Azriel's) in this book that need more explanation! Need more need more!",

I'm sitting here ugly crying.\n\nI've had a rough couple of years. I lost two babies in a row, got a life-changing diagnosis for our only living child, and almost lost my husband because of my own horrible actions that are inexcusable and I honestly just needed to do what I did in order to survive. I got my heart broken, then had my husband put it back together again somehow. Or maybe he just helped me do it on my own. Long story short, I feel like I understand Nesta in ways I've never understood another character. Every bad decision she made, all the while feeling too much while seeming to not care at all ... She's me in so many ways. And seeing her transformation, seeing her overcome... seeing what an amazing person she turned into... It's meant so much to me. I wish I had her bravery, her strength, heck-- even her friends. I wish she was real.\n\nI'm really hopeful to read more books in this world. Elain needs her own book, as does Azrael. I'm excited to see if a certain unexpected someone ends up with Mor, and I want to see what happens with Elain and Lucien and Azrael play out. There are so many incredible characters in this book series, and I feel like it could go on and on and on, since there are threads that have been purposely left hanging loose. Like Nesta, I just can't wait to see what happens next. The future is a beautiful thing, and the next books will be sometime try really look forward to.",

The show does an incredible job of visually representing what I might dream up with on my own. I never would have even heard of the books if Apple had not created the TV series, so I'm grateful all the same for finding this gem. The TV series is about the first half of the book and then its all new material in the pages from there. I already have purchased the other two books of this series and am so excited-I just put down Wool last night and have Shift ready to go. I always find it interesting when a male author speaks through a female character but I loved Jules. I connected with her strength and determination, her stubbornness. I find myself reading post-apocalyptic books and this one did not let me down! I high recommend and will be telling friends and family to read Wool! -Josie",

Holmberg.\n\nSeven years on the run from her abusive father, and with no hope of sanctuary among the dwindling pockets of human civilization, Lark is out of options. Her only leverage is a cursed power: she can thrust fear onto others, leaving all threats fleeing in terror. It’s a means of survival as she searches for a place to call home. If the campfire myths of her childhood are true, Lark’s sole chance for refuge could lie in Cagmar, the city of trolls—a brutal species and the sworn enemies of humanity.\n\nValuing combat prowess, the troll high council is intrigued. Lark could be much more useful than the low-caste humans who merely labor in Cagmar. Her gift makes her invaluable as a monster slayer to fight off the unspeakable creatures that torment the trolls’ hanging city, suspended from a bridge over an endless dark canyon.\n\nLark will do anything to make Cagmar her home, but her new role comes with a caveat: use her power against a troll, and she’ll be killed. Her loyalty is quickly put to the test when she draws the hatred of a powerful troll who loathes humankind. Still, she finds unexpected friendship in the city and, even more surprisingly, love. But if everything else doesn’t undo her, being caught in the arms of a troll surely will. Now in the fight of her life, Lark has a lot to learn—about her past, about trust and hope when all seems lost, and above all, about the extraordinary power of fear itself.",

        "comment": "Charlie N. Holmberg’s novels are something rare in the fiction lover’s world: reliable. When a new novel is published, a reader can buy it and dive in, knowing it will provoke, interest, and satisfy. The Hanging City is well worth reading. It is suspenseful, and even while reading the last few pages, the reader has no idea how the tension will resolve, but resolve it does, in a sudden yet redemptive manner.\nThe Hanging City pits two civilizations against each other: the humans, who live as tribe-like small settlements scattered across the desolate landscape, and the trolli, a larger, more cohesive and resourceful group of beings who built a hanging city beneath the ruins of what was human metropolis in a time long ago, before catastrophic drought devastated the world, making most of the land a barren, dry, dusty wasteland. The rise of the trolli’s prosperity followed the drought-caused descent of humankind, and, at the time of the novel’s narrative action, the two groups harbor a deeply held antipathy and distrust of the other.\nThe novel’s heroine, Lark, is a human girl who has been on her own, moving from one settlement to the next, running from her cruel, abusive father. Lark has a mysterious psychic ability that her father wants to claim and manipulate for his own advancement and gain. Lark makes her way to the hanging city of the trolli, where she (as a human) is rated lowest of the low, not even eligible to join the caste system by which trolli society is organized. She is not welcomed into the city with open arms, but she hopes to be tolerated and to prove her worth to the council, the trolli administration.\nLark, though having no status, still longs for a place to belong, for a family that she can love, and for a group of people who can accept her psychic gift. She begins to be familiar with some of the humans living in the trolli city, and forges fledgling friendships with some of them, including a young man who is a half-breed human/trolli mix.\nAs time passes, Lark hopes a few of the more tolerant trolli might fit into her long-dreamt-of idea of having a community, the “family” she desires. She even begins to have deeper feelings for one male trolli, seeing beauty in his green skin and bony skin protrusions, and, feeling safe in his company, she dares to let down her guard.\nPerils arise, misunderstandings occur, and Lark’s past catches up with her, but when the story’s ending comes, Lark’s future looks as though it could be better than her dreams might have promised. We root for her along the way, and Lark’s dream becomes the reader’s, too.\nIt takes real talent to create fiction in which the reader becomes so involved that he or she viscerally feels every blow, experiences every joy, and hopes so hard for a satisfying conclusion to the story that tears and laughter bubble up in turn. Charlie N. Holmberg has written such a book, again, and I thank her.",

        "comment": "Fleeing her abusive father Lark has roamed across the drought- stricken land looking for a place to call home and people to call family. Each time she thinks she has found a place of safety she is forced to use her talent - the ability to project fear into others - and is forced to flee as the people she thought were friends turn on her in fear of her power. She ultimately finds herself in the city of the trolls where the leader hopes to use her power to protect the city from monsters. Lark seems to have found a home as she makes friends and maybe finally finds love with someone who accepts her even knowing what she can do; but then her father appears seeking to conquer the troll city and everything starts to fall apart.\nThe world building is great; we have a world of drought, humans ecking out an existence with little water available to grow food and then there is the troll city, built into the sides of a deep canyon with access to abundant water and the ability to grow more than enough food. There are monsters in the canyon that attack the city occasionall; but, overall, life in the troll city is good. Lark makes a home for herself with the trolls, learning they are not the ignorant brutes that humans have always portrayed them but instead are literate with engineers and artisans even as all trolls are expected to train hard militarily. Humans are not slaves in the troll city but also not citizens and unable to enter the troll caste system that determines a troll’s place in society. The characters, troll and human, are fully fleshed-out and Lark finds love and a family in the place she least expected to.\nThis is a standalone novel and comes to a satisfying conclusion but I, for one, would love to see a book about the next chapter in Lark’s life. Highly recommended",

        "comment": "Lark has spent seven years running from her father who wants to use her special gift to strengthen his position of power. With nowhere left to go she seeks out Cagmar, the legendary troll city. In order to gain acceptance into the trolls' intricate society, Lark must prove her value and promise to never use her skills against any of the trolls. While she’s seen as an outcast, it isn't long before she gains the curiosity and friendship of the troll siblings responsible for keeping an eye on her.\n\nThe Hanging City is a stand-alone romantasy. This is the best fantasy novel that I have read so far this year. The plot is unlike anything that I have come across before. The storyline is fresh and engaging. If you have never read any of this author’s other work, this is a great place to start. While the story is unique, it is easy to pick up on the author’s distinct style and subtle sense of humor throughout the book.\n\nMost fantasy writing needs several books to convey what this author has seamlessly fit into one volume. Lark’s personal journey plays out smoothly from start to finish. Even the trolls become relatable the deeper into the book you go. Honestly it isn't very long before the plight of the trolls and the struggles of the remaining humans begins to look the same. The ending had me gasping. Even knowing how everything plays out, The Hanging City has great readability.\n\nCharlie N. Holmberg continues to impress me with each new book she releases. She remains one of my favorite fantasy writers and I look forward to seeing what she has next for her readers.\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

        "comment": "I first read this novel several years ago, but had not reviewed it until now. Since I own a copy of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", I decided I needed to revisit the series.\n\nThis second reading was just as delightful as the first! This series just has a freshness, an amazing originality, that I know I'll NEVER get tired of!\n\nPoor Harry Potter has not had an easy life....after all, he's been targeted for bullying and attempted murder. In the first book, not only was he nearly killed by Voldemort, but then grew up being constantly bullied by his nearest relatives, the Dursleys, who are Muggles (non-magical people). Then he started attending the magical boarding school -- Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and found two new enemies: Draco Malfoy, and Professor Snape. All of these characters continue to harass him in this second installment, too.\n\nAmazingly, Harry manages to deal with it all, including the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is ridiculously narcissistic. And in the end, as always, Harry emerges as hero!\n\nIn this book, there's a new mystery to be solved, as several students, and one cat, are Petrified. This means they're literally turned into statues. At the same time, Harry is hearing something very unusual, that no one else can hear. And a certain villain makes a very unexpected appearance....\n\nThe three main characters are GREAT, as usual. Harry remains resolute in solving any and all strange mysteries that may arise, and he has two incredible allies in Hermione and Ron, who back him up in all of his adventures! I love how Hermione constantly turns to books as the answer to every problem that crops up. When in doubt, head for the library! As for Ron, I really admire his loyalty to Harry. He's given Harry some very great help along the way, as well.\n\nAll the secondary characters are also wonderful, which is a Rowling trademark. This is very important, as I do feel that secondary characters can either make or break a novel.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, although very strict, is also very fair, as well as compassionate. Professor Snape is his usual nasty, detestable self, constantly directing his unpleasant remarks to Harry. The Weasleys -- especially Fred and George -- are very comical. I love how the whole family accepts and loves Harry, who is an orphan. And Hagrid is his usual sweet, adorable self! In this novel, we find out more about his rather shadowy past.\n\nThree new minor characters are introduced here -- the house elf, Dobby, Draco's vicious father, Lucius Malfoy, and Professor Gilderoy Lockhart.\n\nPoor Dobby leads a miserable existence, but, in spite of that, he attempts to warn Harry away from Hogwarts. Unfortunately, for some reason, he's not able to tell Harry exactly why it would be dangerous for him to return to the school. My heart went out to him!\n\nI thought it was great that Rowling also threaded in some social commentary through this character. But then, she's been doing that since the first book. It's very obvious that she's against abuse of all types, as this is a recurrent theme in the books. Dobby is mistreated by Lucius on a constant basis. Harry is mistreated by the Dursleys, and abused by Draco and Snape. This is one of the elements of the books that, I'm sure, has contributed to their appeal. Rowling definitely sticks up for the underdog!\n\nThe portrayal of Lucius is very well done. He's cruel, despotic, and evil. He might come across as very stereotypical, as Harry's Muggle relative, Uncle Vernon, does, but again, I think Rowling is using some of her characters to speak out against abuse. Unfortunately, children in particular do suffer a lot of abuse worldwide, and so do other groups who have no access to power of any type.\n\nThrough these two characters, Rowling also makes a very important statement regarding bigotry. Lucius (as well as his son, Draco) detests \"Mudbloods\", which is the name given to magical people whose parents happen to be Muggles. Lucius also loathes elves, as they are powerless to change their own status unless someone helps them out. As for Uncle Vernon, he detests magical people. Both characters are constantly judging and stereotyping those who belong to other, \"different\" groups. Both are, of course, insensitive to the suffering of those they unfairly mistreat.\n\nGilderoy Lockhart provides a lot of the comic relief in this novel. He is incredibly FOND of himself! He's constantly telling people about his supposed magical exploits, as well as pushing his own books, making these a requirement for the subject he's teaching. It turns out that he's just a ridiculous windbag, but, along the way, he provided a lot of laughs at tense points in the narrative.\n\nI also loved the character of \"Moaning Myrtle\", even though she was constantly complaining and whining. I do feel sorry for her. She had self-esteem issues while alive, and these continued to plague her even as a ghost. She just had a very raw deal. Even her death was totally unfair. She does help out our heroes, though. Without the clues she provided, they would not have been able to solve the mystery so easily, and lives would not have been saved.\n\nThe novel ended in a very satisfactory manner, as the first book did. Rowling is obviously not a fan of cliffhangers, which is something I really appreciate! Of course, it was Harry who saved the day. In fact, in this particular installment, I was very strongly reminded of Greek mythology. Harry could have been one of the famous Greek heroes, in that he battled some very great obstacles, and used his intelligence and resourcefulness in doing so. I'm sure this was intentional on Rowling's part. She certainly excels at bringing in all kinds of literary allusions to these books!\n\nRowling's imagination is amazingly fertile, as she brings in more plot twists, more incredible events, and makes her readers wish even more that they studied and lived at Hogwarts! I find it hard to believe that these books should have met with some negative criticism. After all, they fall squarely into the tradition of the hero who triumphs against all odds! And they do so in an entirely unique and very entertaining way, too!",

        "comment": "Why are so many people wild about Harry?\n\nI have a fascination with the thought of teaching at Hogwarts though notice they do not seem to have a philosophy course in the curriculum! Over the last year or so I have read the Harry Potter Books and watched the movies. I listen to the music on the soundtrack CDs while working. It sets a nice mood for me. Why?\n\nThere has been a flurry of writing over the issue of why Potter has been such a hot item. Why do children like to read the books? We have their quotes to read over and think about. Some declare reading them has pulled them away from the abyss and toward success. Adults ponder these issues and offer various reasons why they think they have been so popular with children. Better, they also ponder why the books have been popular with adults as well. Notice that Lady JKR says she wrote the books for herself, because she liked them.\n\nSome have detailed the perfect fit the stories have with the trends in political and economic aspects of British or American society. Others have described the wonderful use the plots make of classic templates that always win hearts and imaginations. Harry is Jesus made flesh. Those who see a satanic cultus have been pretty much laughed out of town or they live in towns most laugh at.\n\nWe also have the interplay with public relations and the media. Lady JKR received good PR even prior to the first publication of HPP/SS. The news media were interested in the poor single mother making good. It was like magic. Scholastic bid high for the rights in America and that meant a burden was on them to produce fans. They did a good job. But of course, the book was good in its own right. The movie stuck to the text, so to speak. One thing AOL did right. The kids would have been disappointed otherwise. Now when we read we picture things according to the film for better or worse. Frankly, I could never have imagined the delivery of lines such as, \"It does not do Harry to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\" as well as Richard Harris did. Bless him. The irony of it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.\n\nWith so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have. There are lots of reasons.\n\nI do not want the story to stop. It bugged me that I had to wait until June to see the last movie and even longer to find out what happens to Harry next. Book 6 is scheduled to come out July 16, 2005 and my order for it is already placed. But I know I have to be patient. I don't want JKR to feel rushed. I want her to do the job right all the way to the word \"scar.\"\n\nWhen I received my order for HPCS, as a side note, I puzzled over this recent development of ordering things before they are published. I have had outstanding orders for about four of five things that have not come out yet. This never used to be the case, at least for me. So this is some new kind of economic development in its own right. I suspect computers had something to do with this. And credit.\n\nI would love to teach at Hogwarts. Imagine! Students studying. Reading assignments and papers done. Students working at the library. (I seriously think Snape is the best teacher there). Reading books after class on school grounds. Students getting along well in their own houses at least. Competition between houses is a good stressor. Teachers get to teach what they consider important and they don't have to worry so much about their popularity. They can be as strict as they want. In fact, if they are not good enough or strict enough they can lose their positions!\n\nNo more casual clothes. Discipline is the order of the day. All you need to do is deduct points or give detentions, even if those are no longer hanging by the thumbs in the dungeons; they are amazingly effective at Hogwarts. Students really behave. School spirit is great. The school spirits are interesting as well.\n\nThe classrooms look like the pits - well, dungeons at least. At least they are not temporary or make shift! And if they are drafty? Except maybe divination class where it is warm on purpose. Students have sweaters and robes to keep them warm. Cooler is always better for staying awake anyway. Heck, even dead teachers can keep going in a school like this! (See professor Bins in the books.)\n\nNo Internet. Heck, no eklectricity at all in fact. But instead of instant messaging there are instant owls. No spam, though there are occasionally howlers. You never have to find someone's address even if they are hiding from everyone. Owls know where they are. Imagine the possibilities! Message to Osama? Better use a timer if you want your owl back. How would that work?\n\nBut I think the reason I would want to teach there is not just the castle and its peculiarities. It's the quality of the students. They are smart and interested. They are the kinds of kids we really want. Is this different than the ones we really have? They come to school reasonably prepared even if some of their wands are defective. There is still the pressure on those who would over indulge in intellectualosity-- maybe I should use the word \"lucubrations\". \"This is light?\" \"How can you be behind in your school work? We are on vacation!\" \"She's a nightmare. No wonder she doesn't have any friends.\" But that sort of thing is resolved. \"Thank goodness. Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\" What could be more rewarding than being her teacher?\n\nI do miss the fine arts. History taught by a dead teacher is not the best critical thinking course. Would critical thinking be out of place in Hogwarts? Not likely. Maybe there is a place for philosophy? At least in Britain.\n\nWell, no tickling sleeping dragons.",

        "comment": "“Magical Midlife Madness” (Leveling Up #1) by K.F. Breene ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Genre: Paranormal Women’s Fiction. Location: The Sierra foothills of Northern California, USA. TIME: present.\n\nTHE SERIES: Jacinta (Jessie) Evans’ husband of 20 years leaves her, and her son leaves for college. She’s 40 and needs a new life. She moves to the tiny town of O’Briens to be caregiver of Ivy House, her friend’s aunt’s creepy old estate. The house comes with Great Uncle Earl, aka Mr. Tom (a cape-wearing butler), and Edgar (a gardener with very long incisors). It’s just temporary, she thinks.\n\nTHIS BOOK: When Jessie arrives, she finds the town includes Niamh (very, very, very old rock-throwing neighbor), and Austin Steele (super sexy bar owner known locally as the “uncrowned alpha”). Ivy House is like a sovereign nation on the outskirts of town. As Jessie becomes aware of why she was hired as caretaker, locals take sides for or against her. And now out-of-owners are coming for her. It’s a dangerous situation that will change her life forever.\n\nI could happily write about any of author Breene’s characters, but for this 1st book, I’m concentrating on Jessie. Breene writes about a woman on fire. She’s going to stop being ignored. Raise her voice until it’s heard. Look however she wants. Be whoever she wants. Demand people pay attention to her. (Plus there’s magic!)\n\nShe is eloquent in describing how Jessie stands up for herself. When Austin punches a drunk for disrespecting her, Jessie points out the increased danger he put her in because of that well-meant but unthinking action. (“…but often a man doesn’t account for how dangerous the fallout can be for a woman.”) Yes! (Plus there’s magic!)\n\nIf a fabulous strong woman protagonist isn’t enough, Breene places her in the middle of a twisted fairytale land. (I wish there was a map of the town!) If you like geriatric gargoyles, unusual shape shifters, and other magical creatures, this might be the book (and series) for you. It’s 4 stars from me.🌵📚💁🏼‍♀️ I’ve already put book 2 on my TBR list.",

It's time to rediscover herself, she decides. But with no job or prospects, she has to crash at her parents' house. But it barely takes 24 hours before she realizes there must be something better to do than stare at her old poster of Brad Pitt and try to avoid looking at her dad in the mornings, who has decided to start off his days **sans** clothing (\"they scratch!\" he claims).\n\nA friend offers her a caretaker job in a small town. Great, she thinks, I liked that eerie old house when I was a kid, and then I can have some time to decide what I'm going to do with my life.\n\nBut Jessie's wrong....very wrong. She didn't pick that house because she liked it. It was the house that picked her - and it wants her very badly to stay. Forever.\n\nAs her all-too-few allies tell her, it's her decision. She can walk away, right now. Or she can stay, and be the focus for the immense power of the house. But if she does that, her mundane human existence is over. All sorts of magical creatures, good and bad, will be attracted to such a source of power.\n\nWhat will she decide to do? Or is the decision going to be made for her?\n\nThere is a lot about this intro book that was fun. Enjoyed the way the mysteries were plotted so that the pacing and tension ratcheted up steadily. I really liked how everyone, including Jessie, realizes that it's her age and experiences that have made her the ideal locus for the house's power; at twenty she wouldn't have been ready to deal with it.\n\nAnd the room full of dolls - oh, that was a GREAT in-joke for every horror movie fan!\n\nThe humor is fun, even if somewhat rote. I rounded the rating up from 3.5 just for the dolls. Otherwise, although entertaining the whole cast of characters was a little too much Generic Supernatural to really stand out. I may or may not read Bk 2, to continue the series. YMMV",

Schwab\n\nKell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.\n\nKell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.\n\nUnofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.\n\nAfter an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.\n\nNow perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.\n\n\"A Darker Shade of Magic has all the hallmarks of a classic work of fantasy.

        "comment": "This book came highly recommended from some participants in a fantasy discussion board I moderate, and I was looking for something to read on my Kindle recently, so I picked it up. It was a lot of fun, and when I finished, I immediately started the second book in the series. (That is an enthusiastic recommendation for me. There are some books where I'm like \"I'll get around to the sequel eventually\" but fewer series where I pick up all the available volumes in a row.)\n\nJust a bit of brief plot summary for context. There are four Londons in this novel, and a select few individuals can magically travel among them. These are referred to as Grey London, Red London, White London, and Black London, and they are different in how magic affects each world, in how (and by whom) it can be used in each world (the equivalent of *our* world is Gray London). The action takes place in the first three; no one has visited Black London in quite a long time. Only London is the same in each world; in other worlds, there is no France, for example, and not even a proper \"England\" in Red London.\n\nThe parallel worlds thing has been done quite a lot in fantasy, but I am fine with that. I like the twist here, that one of our two main characters (Kell, more on him in a bit) is not from our world, but is from Red London, where magic is ubiquitous. (Often, in such stories, including those by Guy Gavriel Kay in the Fionavar Tapestry, in Stephen R. Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books, in Charles Stross's more sci-fi-based Merchant Princes series, etc., it is people from our world traveling elsewhere. So it is nice to see a different perspective.) I also like that this is not set in the present day, but instead in the past. So even though theme is familiar, there are some alterations that manage to make it unique.\n\nWe have two main characters, Kell and Lila. Kell is from Red London, as previously mentioned, while Lila is from Grey London. Both have mysterious pasts; Kell remembers basically nothing before he was taken in by the royal family of Arnes (the country containing Red London) due to his magical abilities. (He is an Antari, marked by having one normal eye and one that is completely black. There are very few Antari, and they are the only ones able to travel among the worlds. They also have nearly unparalleled magical abilities, in general.) Lila is alone on the streets, making a living (such that it is) as a pickpocket and dreaming of being a pirate with her own ship.\n\nThe two of them encounter one another maybe 1/3 of the way through the story and they travel and work together through much of the rest of the book. I wouldn't say their first encounter seems contrived, because there are some uncanny parallels between their two worlds, such as a particular inn/tavern that seems to be co-situated in all three of the Londons Kell has visited, the existence of London and the Thames, etc. Since they both live in London and visit the inn (different Londons and different inns, but eerily the same, as well), it seems they are fated to meet. And their abilities complement one another. Sometimes the secrecy and stealth of a thief is needed, sometimes reputation and magical fighting ability are better suited to the situation. I think they are a good team. There is no romance between them in this book, though it is possible something like that could be set up for the future. Kell's reputation and duties are such that he doesn't seem to be looking for love or to have the time for it (or the trust to share with someone else), while Lila masquerades as a man and doesn't have what would be considered traditional aspirations for a young woman in the society from which she hails. I find the lack of romance refreshing, especially in a mixed-gender pair like this.\n\nThe other thing I like about the characters is that they have nice depth. Both have secrets (including a tantalizing one about Lila revealed about halfway through; I can't wait to see where that goes in future books), both have killed (not just in self-defense), both have flaws, both have their own moral codes that might not be exactly the same as yours or mine. And yet, you are still cheering for them, and not just because other characters are worse. Both are quite sympathetic.\n\nMoving on, there is a lot of action in this book and I think it is well-written. It can be difficult to describe magical battles such that the reader can envision everything that happens, but I felt that was not an issue here. (There were also physical battles, weapons like guns/knives, etc.) I felt there were adequate dangerous situations for both Kell and Lila (and some of their associates); although not everything turned out as I expected, neither just skated through. They ran into difficulties, they had to be resourceful. The sense of danger and the well-written fights made me feel like the plot was always moving forward, and at a nice pace, at that.\n\nSpeaking of the plot, I felt that it was basically self-contained in this book. There were endings for Lila and Kell. But, there were also some interesting possibilities laid out for future books. I am not yet sure where the overall series arc will take us (presumably we will learn the secrets of Lila's and Kell's pasts in future volumes -- I am not yet enough into volume two to see if that is true); however, there are some interesting possibilities for where things could go in the future.\n\nI also liked the writing. As mentioned earlier, it was especially good during action sequences. But I also thought it was good at setting the scene for each of the different Londons. If you opened the book to a random part and didn't know which London you were in, I think you'd be able to guess based on the setting. And, when you were inside the protagonists' heads, their thoughts were different. They had different personalities, different aspirations, different goals. They were not just two aspects of the author projected onto the page. So that was also done well.\n\nIf I had one criticism, it would be that there were a few too many instances of characters being saved from very dire situations or being able to fight when they ought to have been incapacitated. It made for dramatic action, but it was perhaps not quite as believable within the context of the story as the author would have wanted. This is a common issue in fantasy novels, and considering that some degree of magical healing is accounted for here (as well as some consequences), it is not an unforgivable writing sin.\n\nAnyway, on balance, I enjoyed this quite a bit. It was a nice break from the epic fantasy I've been reading lately and I'm glad I picked it up!",

        "comment": "4.25 Magical Mayhem Stars\n\nHistorical Urban Fantasy isn’t something I find very often but I usually enjoy it when I do.\n\nMost people are going to like Kell. And why wouldn’t you? He is a little bit naughty, magical, broody, angsty and tradgic with a lost past. Plus he has a fantastic coat that is actually 5 different coats in one that is added to the magical book items I’d love to have.\n\nAnd I do like Kell quite a bit but Lila was the character that called to me the most in this. She is snarky, deceptive, innovative, bold, uncouth, impetuous, brave and wants to be a pirate when she grows up. What was not to love?\n\n***Lila wondered, not for the first time, if something was wrong with her. Barron used to say so, but Barron was a bore. Looking for trouble, he’d say. You’re gonna look till you find it.\nTrouble is the looker, she’d answer. It keeps looking till it finds you. Might as well find it first.***\n\nThis is set in a slightly different world I like to think of as a sandwich.\n\nLayer one: Grey London ( no magic at all) Lila lives here\n\nLayer two: Red London (Beautiful Red Powerful Magic) Kell lives here and this London is practically perfect in every way\n\nLayer three: White London (Creepy Weird Magic) Something is really amiss in this violent decaying place\n\nLayer four: Black London (Evil Magic Rules Here) Actually this place is so overrun with magic that it has be shut off and blocked from the rest of the London’s so it’s magic doesn’t leak through.\n\nKell is a rare breed of magic user that can travel between all the Londons. Usually he is a messenger for Royalty between the Londons but that is about to change when a piece of Black London ends up in his hands and it could be the thing that might open up the doors and let the magic of Black London through if he can’t find a way to get it back.\n\nThis ended up being a really fast read for me. The set up takes a minute but once Kell and Lila meet we were off to the races and I couldn’t read it fast enough. They have this great chemistry together on the page and no it isn’t what you are thinking there is not really even much of a romance going on between them they are just so different and so they play off one another very well.\n\n***. “What are you?” she asked.\n“A monster,” said Kell hoarsely. “You’d better let me go.”\nThe girl gave a small, mocking laugh. “Monsters don’t faint in the presence of ladies.”\n“Ladies don’t dress like men and pick pockets,” retorted Kell.\nHer smile only sharpened. “What are you really?”\n“Tied to your bed,” said Kell matter- of- factly.\n“And?”\nHis brow furrowed. “And in trouble.”****\n\nLila really made this story for me. I loved the character that she was just finding out about magic in the world and instead of being reluctant she is ready to jump into this new word doing a cannonball and create as big of a splash as possible.\n\nThe piece of magic from Black London was really intriguing and I liked seeing how it was different than the magic Kell knew how use. I really wanted to get a look inside of Black London to see if it was really as bad as they suspect.\nWhen doors ran between your world and mine, and others, and anyone with a bit of power could pass through. Magic itself could pass through. But the thing about magic,” added Kell, “is that it preys on the strong- minded and the weak- willed, and one of the worlds couldn’t stop itself. The people fed on the magic and the magic fed on them until it ate their bodies and their minds and then their souls.”\n\nAll and all I really liked this book. Kell is an interesting character and I liked the little hints given for the direction that his story is might go. His past is a mystery but he was raised by the king and queen so one has to wonder if they are part of the cause of his past being a mystery or if they adopted him since his magic would be a valuable tool. Lila’s potential is just as great. For someone that comes from a world with no magic it will be interesting to see what she can do in worlds with it and how much more trouble she can get into.\n\nRys is Kell’s brother the Prince. They are close and I love the bond between them. Rys got to be the playboy in this book but I wonder if he will get a larger role in the continuation of the series after what happened in this one. I think that man would flirt with a plant if he thought it would sit up and take notice.\n\n***“You are surely not an intrusion,” he said, pushing himself up in the bed. “Though I fear you’ve met me rather out of my usual state of grace. Do you have a name?”\nDelilah Bard,” she said. “We’ve met before. And you looked worse.”\nRhy laughed silently. “I apologize for anything I might have done. I was not myself.”\n“I apologize for shooting you in the leg,” said Lila. “I was myself entirely.”***\n\nOverall:\n\nIf you are a fan of UF and 19th century London then this could be just what you were looking for.",

Star-crossed hearts bleed and the first sparks of war ignite in this dark romantic fantasy loosely inspired by the Greek myth of Astraea and the fall of the Golden Age.\n\n\"The brightest star needs the darkest night.\"\n\nIn a world abandoned by the celestial guardians and left to suffer a tyrant king’s reign, all Astraea knows is safety in seclusion. With fragmented memories of only five years of her life, she’s determined to discover more about her past, even if that means fleeing the cruel arms that hold her safe from the wicked vampires rumored to roam the land.\n\nBut when Astraea stumbles upon the mysterious Nyte, she soon realizes determination alone isn’t enough to guard her heart. He lingers like the darkness that expands between the stars, and soon she discovers her captor’s wicked means of control weren’t based on a lie to keep her under locks after all. In her desperation, Astraea accepts Nyte’s help before she can decide if she might have sold her allegiance to one of the bloodthirsty beings the people of her world fear.\n\nOnce their bargain is struck, Astraea’s chance to escape comes in the form of accompanying her best friend Cassia to the King’s Central. There on royal territory it’s the centenary of the Libertatem, a succession of trials hosted by the king in which five human lands compete for a cycle of safety from the vampires seeking blood, claiming souls, and savaging after dark. So when tragedy strikes, Astraea must decide if taking the place of a murdered participant for the safety of her kingdom is a ruse is worth dying for, or if protection—and the answers to her past—really are her strongest desires.",

        "comment": "\"Once upon a time there was a war between stars. What started as a beautiful collision turned out to have the most dire consequences for the world\"\n\nI absolutely loved this first book in a new fantasy series by Chloe C. Peñaranda. This is a tale of truly star-crossed lovers, twined with a journey of stunning revelations and devastating betrayal. Like her previous series, An Heir Comes to Rise, we are given bits and pieces throughout the story, little hints that lead us towards a thrilling end. This book was no different, and I enjoyed every minute of it!\n\nWe follow Astraea, a young woman who has no memory of her past, only that she was found and kept hidden for the last few years. The world is inhabited by vampires, fae, humans, and celestial gods live and rule beyond the Veil. When she finally breaks free to travel with a friend to the Central city, her friend is brutally murdered and Astraea must take her place in a ruthless game to compete for the safety of her region against the ruthless vampires. Meanwhile, she is followed by a presence that she both trusts and is wary of. Nyte is as helpful as he is confounding, mysterious and familiar, both present and not at all. Astraea find herself drawn to him more and more over the course of the book. He is using her, but is helping to keep her alive through the trials as well. Can she trust herself, while her memories are still fragmented? Or Nyte, who promises to keep her safe but keeps his past hidden from her as well?\n\n\"We're only just getting started on the impossible, my Starlight.\"\n\nI gave this book 4.5 stars, only because it felt a little slow in the beginning, which is completely understandable as the first book in series. We have to go through a lot of worldbuilding first, and since we follow Astraea, who has very little knowledge of the world due to her lost memories, we are learning a lot along with her. But things pick up and move very quickly towards a thrilling ending that also left me wanting more in this world. I adored Astraea's growth in this book, as she comes to terms with her past and who she is today. And Nyte! Such a wonderfully complex, morally grey character, and I cannot wait to see more from him - definitely new book boyfriend material!",

I saw an aesthetic reel on Instagram with a list of tropes and a quote and I was sold…but also this cover is STUNNING\n\nThough this book contains fae, vampires, humans, and other creatures like many other fantasy stories, I appreciated how different they were and that there was a good mix of species throughout the story instead of focusing on one.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most about this book is the singular POV and the swoony banter and tension between the two MCs Astraea and Nyte. I was taken on this whole journey with Astraea trying to find out who she is, where she came from, why she’s been treated a certain way for years, as well as why she’s frustratedly attracted to Nyte. One of my favorite ways to discover new worlds is through the character’s point of view and having Astraea suffer memory loss is a plot device that I love.\n\nI loved the detailed descriptions and dialogue that happens throughout the book; though it also makes it difficult to recap what has happened because there is a lot of inner monologue happening as well as outer dialogue scattered throughout.\n\nYou may enjoy this book if you like the following tropes:\n✨single POV\n✨memory loss\n✨mysterious origins\n✨ancient prophecy\n✨star crossed lovers\n✨Villain gets the girl/he’ll burn the world for her\n✨ Touch her/touch him you 💀\n✨ A of spice and some steamy/sensual moments 😏\n\nThere’s romance, steamy sensual moments with one fairly long and somewhat detailed spicy scene, witty banter, a Hunger Games style competition (to an extent), plenty of action, tons of mystery, a female main character who is the epitome of doing something even when you’re afraid…especially when you’re afraid.",

It’s peace and it’s company.”\n✨\n✨\nAstraea has spent the last five years with broken memories, illness, and protection through her captor yet savior Hektor. When Astraea is given the chance to join Cassia on her journey to the King’s Central, she decides to break free from her cage. However, things do not go to plan and Astraea is faced with an unimaginable choice: become a competitor in the Libertatem or run.\n✨\n✨\nPeñaranda crafted an engaging and complex story with The Stars are Dying. There was a lot going on with the plot which kept the pace moving at a pretty steady pace through most of the story between Astraea’s time with Hektor, reaching Central, competing in the Libertatem, and after. I do wish more time was spent on the trials and riddles. Having to figure out the clues was one of my favorite elements of the entire story. Overall, I do believe some of the plot points became unnecessarily confusing especially some of the scenes early on with Nyte. I was able to figure out what was happening but there were times I had to reread the scene to fully grasp what was happening.\nI really enjoyed the cast of supporting characters especially Cassia, Zath, Rose, and Davina. I enjoyed Astraea but wish we saw more development from her. Given the issues with her memories, I’m hoping to see a lot more growth from her in the next book. As far as Nyte, I’m still on the fence how I feel about him. Given that he’s written in the morally grey/villain vein, I don’t think that’s wholly unexpected.\nThere are several fan favorite bookish tropes features throughout the story:\nOne horse\nWho hurt you\nTouch her and die\nMemory loss\nMagic trials\nStar crossed lovers\nOverall, I enjoyed the story and plan to continue the series. There was enough political intrigue, mystery surrounding Astraea, betrayals, and twists to keep my interest.",

        "comment": "I love this series, I love Katee Roberts, BUT the ending was SO uncharacteristic to the world that she created, that the love story becomes secondary to the maddeningly frustrating end. I find myself not even caring about the main characters because the ending is so ridiculous. It's one of those where plot points are advancing because the author needs a nemesis (or a family of them in this case), not because the plot points make any kind of sense in the world of the novel.\n\nOkay - firstly, I LOVE Cassandra, and I love Apollo. Their love story feels real, and you feel immersed within the emotional development of the characters, and the romantic development is intuitive and feels like a natural conclusion. It really is a joy to read. Katee Roberts writes spicy scenes like no one else. (Okay, her and J.R. Ward are tied.) I really liked these two characters... it's a shame their story is overshadowed by this dumb ending.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nOkay -\n\nOkay - was anyone else absolutely frustrated at the ridiculous ending??!!! How were the cunning, cutthroat, intelligent leaders of Olympus blind and unable to act upon an obvious flipping solution to the conflict at hand? Like, eliminate this problem people, what are you doing??? It felt so forced and so fake, that it literally took me out of the rest of the book. It felt like the author is forcing her characters to do stupid things, and make stupid decisions, in order to further conflict for the rest of the series.\n\nSPOILERS -\n\nI still can't believe this... okay, so Minos is this conniving guy who has blackmailed Zeus into giving himself and a number of his \"children\" citizenship in Olympus in exchange for information on a vague \"threat\" to Olympus. This is the same Minos who had two of his \"sons\" try to take the position of Ares (from the previous book). Minos throws a great big party where he invites a number of the Thirteen to this party. Oh, by the way, Minos has yet to provide the information on this \"threat,\" and apparently the great and powerful Zeus and his advisors are stumped as to what to make of his deceptive and secretive guy. Dear reader - you've already figured out who at least one of the immediate threats is, haven't you? Well, you're one up on the Thirteen.\n\nThe previous books have already set the stage that assassination of certain members of the Thirteen will give the role to killer. But, if you fail, you die. And, your family also dies or suffers. It was not only in previous books, but is also a major plot point in Cassandra's backstory. Gee - you see where I'm going with this? Well, now you're two up on Thirteen.\n\nAt the party Minos is, literally, playing parlor games to isolate members of the Thirteen with his beautiful daughters seeking marriage, or with his violent sons... and there are random disappearances and a beloved person is attacked and gravely injured during this party... and people are, like, huh, that's weird. Also, there's no security around, just Minos and his kids. And, you already know what's happening, don't you? Well, now you're three up on the Thirteen.\n\nAnd the finale is revealed that the violent sons attempted to murder a total of FOUR members of the Thirteen, and are successful in one. (There is a first, earlier, botched attempt on Aphrodite - the sister of Zeus and Ares - and when this information is discovered and passed along, it's kinda ignored for some INSANE reason. How come that's allowed to fly??) Again, all of this is known to be orchestrated by Minos.\n\nAnd, so, what happens to Minos and his assassin sons? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. The successful assassin son gets to join the Thirteen, like, ta da. Okay. BUT this same assassin had also tried to kill Apollo, too, and that's apparently no problem. They tried to kill THREE other members of the Thirteen and failed... why is it no problem?? Why isn't Cassandra wondering why the Thirteen killed her parents for SO MUCH LESS?? I mean, her parents didn't try to kill FOUR of the Thirteen, they just tried to kill one. I guess her parents' big mistake is that they needed to attempt to assassinate MORE of the Thirteen, and then they would have been totally safe.\n\nAlso, Cassandra is the only one who can verify that this assassin murdered the member of the Thirteen (the murder needs to be witnessed in order to join the Thirteen), and she's, like, okay, no problemo, I'll happily confirm this. All she had to do was lie, and say, nope, didn't see it. WHY are Ares, Apollo, ZEUS, etc., allowing Cassandra to confirm this information...?? And, Cassandra, Ares, Apollo, and Patroclus are literally standing in a private, isolated place with the injured and incapacitated assassin - all talking about how unsafe and unstable everything is because this one assassin was successful - an assassin who JUST had a failed attempt on Apollo - and.. and, nothing. By the rules of Olympus, couldn't anyone one of them kill the assassin and then taken the position back??? Doesn't this assassin forfeit his life for his attempt on Apollo?? Doesn't Minos forfeit HIS life for orchestrating the attempt on Aphrodite?? But, nah, we gotta keep our nonsensical plot points. OH, and there's a saboteur in the Thirteen that EVERYONE KNOWS SHE HELPED MINOS DO THIS. And, again, no problemo. It makes zero sense.\n\nIt is really frustrating that such a good book had such a dumb ending. I'll still read the next book because I really like her writing, but darn it, this one made me mad.",

        "comment": "This was like a giant game of Clue with a house party a la historicals and everything, where it’s like some of the most powerful people in Olympus were trying to get unalived by walking into a ridiculously obvious trap. I mean I get it, politics, but they have only themselves to blame for the whole debacle that goes down. Regardless, the plot was crazy and pretty fun as it unfolded, even though initially I could not for the life of me decide whether I loved or hated the bafflingly complicated machinations going on but I was eventually into it.\n\nA lot happens in this book plot and adventure wise, still this is also the softest and most romantic dark Olympus installment yet. Scminky yes, but softly so. It’s also the trope-iest with its fake relationship forced proximity only one bed scenarios. Apollo the soft considerate stern brunch daddy dom and Cassandra his mouthy brat definitely gave me the tingles, but they didn’t blow my world. Okay fine it’s coz they both feel too nice. Apollo would realistically make a great boyfriend. But. He was strangely not great at his job and it felt like Cass was the mastermind who made his job happen? Idk maybe it was just coz he kept saying he could never have done so and so but that’s what it felt like.\n\nOverall this felt like a prelude to the next book which is bound to be explosive following the events of that ending, and with Aphrodite and Hephaestus already throwing poisonous darts and shady maneuvers at each other which has me hella excited for their messy little poly knot. Because the polyam combos is where the series has shone for me so far. Like most of Katee’s work. And also because until then I was just entirely focused on Zeus and Hera and consumed by my desperate need for their book. How Ms Katee has managed it I don’t know but Zeus is the most interesting character in this series and that’s not going to change for me anytime soon. Even Hermes who’s been built up to be all that rings a little hollow, like we are supposed to be dazzled by her so we are, but I’m not super impressed. That of course, could change with her book, but until then cold but I bet secretly caring Zeus is it for me.",

I find that each book is unique enough that it brings something different to the world yet they all cohesively fit together for the overarching plot of the series.\n\nRadiant Sin was a different pace then the first 3 books, but it definitely was needed for the plot to move forward. We get more characters (who will be important in later books) and we get a sweet romance with the spice that hits.\n\nEach book in this series is a fun time and I am excited for Cruel Seduction.",

Maas, and Laura Thalassa.\n\nShe sold her soul to a siren and now he’s come to collect.\n\nVictoria risks everything to leave a dangerous marriage and gain a second chance at life. But when her escape goes awry, she finds herself caught in the strong embrace of a mysterious siren, forced to choose: temporary salvation or immediate death.\n\nAnd so, a cursed deal is struck.\n\nFive years later, Victoria is alive—and the world’s finest ship captain. But her debt to the siren looms while her conniving ex has demanded a king’s ransom as the final price of her freedom. Victoria refuses to cause her family to suffer any more on her behalf, and is determined to make things right before her time is up. But that time is cut short.\n\nThe siren comes for her. Six months early.\n\nTaken to the magical and deadly Eversea, home of the sirens, Victoria discovers she’s the sacrifice upon which all sirens pin their hopes. If they want to appease an angry god and save a world on the brink of destruction, then they need her. Which gives her the perfect leverage.\n\nVictoria strikes a new bargain: the Siren Duke will help save her family, and she’ll fulfill his demands. It’s a good bargain until a flicker of passion ignites in the scarred remnants of Victoria's heart, threatening all she's worked for. As the sacrifice for the God of Death, she’s meant to give up everything that draws her to the world of the living. But that’s impossible when all she can think about is how this handsome siren’s song, and his hands, make her feel very much alive.\n\nIn a realm of ancient magic, submerged secrets, and forgotten gods, can love find a place among shattered hearts as they race against time and the blossoming of forbidden desires? Or will the delicate songs of their hearts be silenced once and for all?\n\nA Duet with the Siren Duke is a complete, *stand alone novel*. It’s for readers looking for a fantasy romance with deep lore, second-chance love, sacrifice, forbidden and slow-burn romance that sizzles on the page, and a happily ever after where love triumphs over all.",

        "comment": "I first found Elise Kova’s books through a book tour I participated in a few years ago. The book I read was A Deal With the Elf King, the first in the Married to Magic series. I was hooked. I was so excited to become part of her Tower Guard and have now helped release the next 3 books. Thank you, Elise, for inviting me along. I absolutely loved this book!\n\nVictoria makes the decision to leave her abusive marriage. She just wants to be reunited with her family and start a fresh new life of her own. But, her escape meets with disaster and she finds herself striking a bargain with a siren in order to save her life, even if only temporary. When the siren comes for her, 6 months early, it seems she’s only escaped one prison to be trapped in another. But, maybe this bargain was her true purpose and one that will save more than just her own loved ones. Maybe, Victoria and Illryth can save their whole world from the destructive anger of the old gods.\n\nI love Victoria’s tenacity. Yes, it’s hard for her to let go of her abusive past. She definitely has PTSD and anxiety from her trauma. But she always finds purpose in the next thing. She gets a new job as a ship captain. She provides for her family and pays her own debts while she is waiting for the siren to come collect her. Then another disaster hits and she is whisked away by the Siren Duke. When she comes to terms with the fact that this is it and she is never going home, Victoria makes this bargain her new purpose. She always tries to make the most of the situations she finds herself in, even through her fright and grief. She never truly loses hope.\n\nThis is a beautiful story of putting the pieces back together, over and over again, until the vessel is complete, even if the pieces shift and morph into something completely different. It’s a story of loss and forbidden love. Of how a whole society clings to the stories of what life should be like that were passed down through the ages, even when those things are no longer working. Of overcoming fear to embrace the possibility of change for the good of all. There are so many life lessons scattered throughout. The main theme, however, is love. Love in all its many forms and things we do for those loved ones and the lands we cherish. How love truly does conquer all.\n\nThe forbidden love story is so romantic and swoon-worthy. It’s slow-burn, but you just know (hope) that eventually this couple is going to end up together. They each hold back for their own reasons but it was just meant to be. And, it is heart-wrenching. There were so many scenes that I cried through. Elise just knows how to write a good romance!\n\nIn my opinion, there is only one true villain. This story is filled with a cast of morally grey characters. People who would do anything for those they care about, even if it’s wrong. They all have redeemable qualities,\n\nElise writes good, compelling stories. She makes you care about her characters. She builds worlds that you’d love to visit. And her romance is swoon-worthy. Truly, there’s not one thing I would change about this one. The ending is surprising and so bittersweet. You think you have it all figured out, but I promise you don’t. This is fantasy romance at its best.\n\nI highly recommend A Duet With the Siren Duke to fans of fantasy, fantasy romance, forbidden love, fated mates, soulmates, The Little Mermaid, Orpheus and Eurydice, morally grey characters, and swoon-worthy romance.",

        "comment": "It’s taken me longer than anticipated to finish this series mainly because I didn’t really love the second book in Shades of Magic as much as I did the first. Certain main characters in the second book just really got on my nerves, and we’ll leave it at that. So “A Conjuring of Light” sat on my shelves, waiting ever so patiently, for me to stop being petty and just finish the series. The third book picks up immediately after the second book, so if you’re like me and waited a while to return you’re going to need a bit of a refresher and recap before diving in, because the story doesn’t really allow for that right off the bat. But our main characters know from the start (or close to it) just what they face, and what will happen if they don’t deal with this threat, and atone for their own mistakes. Cue redemption arcs for everyone! Sure, some characters are redeemed more than others but I always love a good redemption. I love watching characters face the consequences of previous actions, and I love having those characters grow from the experience and strengthen their own relationships in the process. So, in a nutshell: I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially compared to “A Gathering of Shadows”.\n\nI love Schwab’s emotive writing, always have, always will, but it is one of those styles that you either love or hate and I get that. I personally tend to love it. Her writing is always emotional without coming across as redundant and I find that to be truly lovely, especially given all the POV characters we get in this book.\nWe get more backstory of what Holland endured before the Dane’s got to him and I loved seeing the brutality that is White London through his eyes before he became an unwilling puppet to Athos and Astrid. For a character who really messed up in his desire for freedom, these tiny flashback moments really helped to show just how tragic Holland always was and made him facing his consequences all the more impactful. Even Lila deals more with her grief this time and I really enjoyed watching her mature emotionally. She’s always been this “devil be damned” type character, but after my issues with her in book 2, let’s just say she really needed this character growth. Then there is poor Kell and Rhy, ugh, RHY. My heart constantly aches, breaks, patches itself up, and then breaks all over again for these brothers. Schwab has never been kind to them and the things they live through in this book is no different. So be prepared for the emotional rollercoaster this relationship will put you through. We also learn more about King and Queen Maresh and while I loved learning about the king and the sacrifices he made for his people, I can’t say the same thing for the queen… Either way, I can confidently say that this book is the most character driven of the three, which obviously shows in the sheer length of the story.\n\nThe plot can be a bit slow at times because of the POV shifts, some of which were not really that necessary, let’s be honest, but I didn’t mind them either. There are still some lingering questions about Kell and Lila’s origins which, now that Schwab has announced more books in this series may actually get answered. I think if I had read this earlier, when that new set of books in this world hadn’t been announced, the open-ended questions about these two main characters would probably bother me more, but such is my faith in Schwab that I trust her to not just leave those things open forever especially given where both Lila and Kell are at the end of this book. Additionally, Osaron didn’t feel as menacing as he was in “A Gathering of Shadows”. There was more tension prior to the final showdown with him then during the actual altercation which has me wondering if Schwab is up to something there was well, but we’ll see!\n\nWas this book perfect? No. Was this series without its flaws? Also no. But does Schwab know how to write an amazing character driven novel full of rich personalities and emotive writing that can leave you gutted? Yes, an emphatic yes! Ultimately, that’s what makes me love this book in particular: Schwab’s writing and the way she made me care for characters like Holland with an intensity I didn’t think was possible. I still think I may wait a bit to see what’s up with the new books in this series before diving in, because if certain arcs don’t get more attention, and certain questions aren’t answered, I may come back and change this rating. But for now, this is a very comfortable 5 star read for me with a satisfying conclusion to the first trilogy in this series.",

        "comment": "I loved the first book in this series and I was less than enthusiastic about book two. My main problem with book two was the magic tournament. I just wasn't interested in this as a major event in the book; instead, the events happening behind the scenes, so to speak, were much more interesting. Thus, I was still excited to read this novel, book three. Because there can't be TWO magic tournaments in one series, right?\n\nAnd this was definitely better than book two, though, at least to me, probably not as good as book one. If you are a fan of the series, definitely read it. If you were put off by book two, I'd still encourage you to read this one -- it is much better, plus you get some resolution. If you haven't started the series at all, go back to book one. This won't make the least bit of sense without it. (Also there are minor spoilers for books one and two here.)\n\nThere aren't really any new characters introduced here. All the major players were in books one and two. They may have had minor roles in the previous books (e.g., some sailors) but they are familiar faces. (I kind of think the second book, in addition to having the magic tournament, was an excuse to introduce a bunch of minor players for a side-plot that occurs near the end of this book.) Anyway, our main characters are Kell, an Antari (basically a top-level magic user) who has been adopted into the royal family of Arnes (where a parallel London exists), Lila, a thief from this book's equivalent of our world, Rhy, Kell's adoptive brother, Holland, Kell's Antari nemesis from yet another parallel London, and Alucard, a noble from Arnes who has been a mentor to Lila, an adversary to Kell, and a lover to Rhy.\n\nI'll be honest, I didn't like Holland in the previous books. I think we weren't supposed to. We find out a lot more about him, about what's been driving him, here, and he becomes much more sympathetic. Holland's backstory is a good way to work in character development in a book with no new characters. (We also get a little background on Rhy's parents, as they get a few POV scenes. I found it difficult to identify with Emira, Rhy's mother, but Maxim, his father, was a bit easier to understand. I am going to have to take these bits about them and go back and think about their parts in books one and two now, to see if their actions make more sense. It is a little odd placing these bits of information here, near the end of the series, with Rhy really coming into his own. But if you like character studies, there is something for you here.)\n\nI'm going to take a detour here and talk about what I didn't like. There were a couple of mysteries hinted at in earlier volumes that weren't resolved to my satisfaction. We learned earlier on that Lila was missing an eye and had a glass eye, but we never find out the circumstances surrounding the loss of her eye. We can speculate based on what we find out about her abilities in this book, but that is not quite the same as getting actual answers. Also, Kell wonders a lot about his past in the previous books; even his name comes from initials carved into his arm (KL). The speculation about Kell's past is at its highest point when he is on the outs with the royal family in Arnes in book two, but he gets a little more information here and then just kind of drops it. It's almost like the author remembered she hadn't handled this at the last minute and inserted the bit where he is given key information at the last minute. It's not really believable to me that someone who spent all of book two feeling put out that he had basically been used as a possession by his adoptive family, never allowed to leave the city, etc., suddenly accepts the Arnesian royals and forgets about everything else. In the scope of things, I guess these are minor, but they stand out to me, nonetheless.\n\nAnyway, another thing I didn't care for was the main antagonist (Osaron). Although he does have some flaws that are, of course, exploited by the good guys, he is just too one-dimensional for me. He is a creature of magic and although it is tempting to read human motivations in him, he doesn't really have human characteristics. (On the other hand, I generally like the strategies the \"good guys\" come up with to deal with him. There are some successes -- including by members of the royal guard, priests, and other everyday people, not just the powerful main protagonists. But there are also some failures.)\n\nOne final complaint: at multiple points in the book, an object that was desperately needed by the characters to further the plot was mentioned. Once, it was a map. Another time, it was a particular artifact (the name of which escapes me). The map, at least, had been mentioned going all the way back to book one, though Lila, to whom it used to belong, didn't know what its purpose was. But in any case, each time the existence of such an object was mentioned, some character knew exactly where to find one. (One could make a similar argument about some rings found by Kell at the equivalent of a magic flea market. Although in that instance, he didn't even know what he needed and it still fell into his lap.)\n\nWhat I did like: I was just more interested in reading this book than book two. I got through it a lot faster, chose to read instead of doing other things, etc. That is nearly always a good sign for me. Events surrounding Holland kept me guessing, too. Holland was actually a big strength for me in this book. He's a tragic character, but he and Kell are also stand-ins for their respective societies' treatment of magic and Antari and the struggle to survive. Holland knows more but he had to know more to get by. He's broken inside by what he's had to do, but he retains a bit of the idealism or optimism of his past.\n\nA lot more was at stake in this book than just bragging rights for a tournament winner, and that was also appreciated. Plus, we get to see a little more of the world here. (What we see fits nicely with what we already know about Arnes and the surrounding lands and sea.) Despite some heroic efforts, everyone takes losses.\n\nOther aspects of the book -- the writing style, the worldbuilding, etc. -- fit right in with everything developed in the previous two volumes. There are a few made-up words, but they generally fall under two categories (1) describing things that don't exist in our world or (2) activate spells (e.g., for the Antari to travel), so these don't bother me overly much. Other than that, honestly, the writing is not so noticeable. It simply fades to the background as it does its job of telling the story.\n\nEven though I had a lot of issues with this book, I'm inclined to go easy on it as far as a star rating goes. I feel that it does need more stars than I gave book two, but not as many as I gave book one, and that leaves a 4. This is probably more of a 3.5 for me, but I'll round up.",

Well . . . by all but one.\n\nDante Regio, prince of Luce, had owned my heart since he gave me my first kiss.

This is a singular POV romance read that focuses on Fallon as she begins to learn about the deceptions and lies the kingdom, she loves has made everyone believe.\n \nWhile Fallon is extremely sheltered, naïve and innocent in this book, I felt like she was also written the way it needed to be. It is hard to remember that a 22 year-old who lives amongst immortals is a very young FMC and Olivia wrote her inner growth in this first book really well.\n \nThe book centers around Fallon as she embarks on quest to “free to crows” to ensure she becomes queen. I found it maddening and ironic that she never clarified who she would be queen for and also understood since this book is still fully team Dante.\n \nDante is the main MMC in this book and I was not a fan of him. I think he is best described as a hero-type villain who takes advantage of Fallon’s feelings for him. I found myself loving and hating him in this book but by then end it was more especially after he sleeps with her and leaves.\n \nOlivia does a fantastic job of creating a fantastical world where the history of a species was erased. I enjoyed reading about Fallon’s curiosity for the outside world and her conflicting emotions towards the beliefs her Kingdom has and what she learns. I also really loved Lore and his character development from Crow to Man. The origins and life he had prior to being enslaved kept me on the edge and I was excited we got to get a chapter from him at the end.\n \nThis is a terrific first installment and is perfect for romantasy readers!\n \nRating: 9/10, Fallon, you go girl!",

She goes through so many ups and downs and comes out on the other side harder. I loved her arc in book one and I can't wait to see what trouble she gets into next.\n\nThis had a slower start setting everything up and then... I. Couldn't. Stop. Reading. It has all of the things we love in a fantasy but also was unique at the same time. It was refreshing. The communicating telepathically is a new favorite for me. It's so intimate and the banter was hilarious. Some parts had me dropping my jaw until I thought it would fall off.\n\nOne thing I absolutely loved, the epilogue. From the different POV and the last line, I'm all swoony over it! 100% recommend!",

Well done, Olivia Wildenstein.\n\nFallon is a magicless halfling fae working at a tavern of questionable reputation. When she finally decides to stretch her metaphorical wings from under the über-protectiveness of her grandmother, she becomes the recipient of a cryptic prophesy that she believes will enable her to achieve her deepest dreams, namely the attention and love of the fae prince, Dante. Adventure ensues as she begins to fulfill the prophesy and seeks to free the crows.\n\nI really enjoyed this book despite my annoyance with Fallon. She’s 22 but seems so much younger and immature, probably due to how she’s been shielded and her own naïveté. I do feel like we see a lot of growth in her character through the book as she makes discoveries and learns about some hidden truths. I enjoyed the adventure and race against time. I got a little confused with the amount of world building but I pushed through and feel like I had a decent enough grasp by halfway through the book. We don’t get much romance in this book but the potential is delicious and I’m really excited for book 2!",

I definitely enjoyed the world building, and I do love a good slow burn. I feel like the author build up Fallon and Lore’s relationship very well. From enemies to soon be lovers.

    "synopsis": "Murderbot—the sardonic, almost-homicidal, media-loving android created by Martha Wells—has proven to be one of the most popular characters in 21 st century science fiction. Everything that makes this protagonist (it would be wrong to call Murderbot a hero) beloved of fans is on display in Compulsory.\n\nWhile trying to watch episode 44 of The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, Murderbot is—again, what is it with humans?—distracted by something that is technically outside its purview. A miner is suddenly in danger following a pointless (to Murderbot’s way of thinking) argument, and the choice is to risk discovery and leap into action, which would require hitting the pause button during a very exciting part of SanctuaryMoon, or to follow orders and stay still.\n\nThis is a tougher choice than it seems. But then, when has Murderbot ever been faced with an easy choice?\n\nA shorter version of this story originally appeared in Wired magazine.",

Even The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon is still a relatively recent discovery.\n\nMurderbot is under contract as security in a mine, and its duty is to protect, not the workers, but the equipment. Well, unless death or injury to an employee will negatively affect production.\n\nMurderbot is on duty, but watching a Sanctuary Moon episode rather than truly paying attention to what's going on nearby, when a fairly foolish argument breaks out between two humans, and results in a stupid accident which sends one of them falling down the mineshaft. When she catches herself on a piece of the equipment, fall halted temporarily, Murderbot has to decide what to do.\n\nSave the fallen miner, and expose itself as no longer under the control of its governor module? Keep (outwardly) following orders, while (inwardly) watching Sanctuary Moon? Which means, letting the miner die for no good reason?\n\nIs there a third alternative?\n\nThis is an important turning point for Murderbot, and a formative moment for the Murderbot we come to know and appreciate in its later adventures.\n\nI bought this book.",

        "comment": "This is easily one of the best examples of a true enemies to lovers story I’ve read in some time. Samkiel and Dianna are without a doubt, on opposite sides of the table. And in the beginning, when either of them gets a chance, there is zero hesitation to attack, torture, or attempt to otherwise unalive the other. Even when their circumstances throw them together, and they’re forced to cooperate with each other, there is very little to any amount of lust or other kind of positive emotion flowing between them. They also have some of the best banter, and as things do finally start shifting for them, it just got better and better. I absolutely loved their dynamic and how they played off each other in different scenarios, him in her world, her in his world, there are some truly fantastic moments. Fish out of water Samkiel at what is essentially a county fair is by far one of my favorite moments. And they both have some absolutely great moments of jealously that they definitely would not admit was jealously. Add to that the journey they’re on for the sake of the plot, and the slow burn tension (which as I mentioned doesn’t even start right away), and it all makes for an engrossing and consuming story. Both of these characters are magically strong in their own right, and they challenge and frustrate each other in equal measure. The build up was well paced, and the cliffhanger ending….so great. I can’t wait for more of this series.\n\nAnd if you’re an audiobook reader, the narration for this book was excellent. Ruthie Bowles does an excellent job giving Dianna the perfect voice, and she does a very good job bringing Samkiel to life as well. I very much enjoyed listening to this book, and will be making it a point to continue the rest of this series on audiobook as it is released.",

My understanding increased once I got to the 50% mark, but the rough start made it hard for me to commit fully to liking this book.\n\nBesides that– I LOVED how mmorally grey both MCs were. Dianna is a supreme badass and witty as hell, and Liam is an absolute simp disguised as the king of gods. I'm always a sucker for enemies-to-lovers, and the enemies definitely enemied and the lovers definitely loved!! That theme unfolded perfectly, so I was definitely satisfied. And then...

I've never been a big fantasy reader, but Bookstagram got me intrigued with another fantasy novel and then of course once you stratch that itch, there's no looking back! Technically my 2nd fantasy novel but I thought it was great. As with any similar book, there's a learning curve for new worlds and getting it set up but this book just jumps RIGHT in. They're not assuming you need 3 chapters at the get go to figure it all ou t; nope, you will just learn as you go. I loved that!\n\nI think I also liked that the main female character was a \"villian\" that you learned to root for; most of the time it's the \"damsel in distress\" and the strong male character that helps her come out of her shell. I also really liked that it read more like a novel for adults, than a \"Young Adult\" novel (like Divergent). This was much less about teen angst, or young love, or going through some military school to learn skills - and I very much appreciate that.\n\nThe banter between the 2 main characters was just very well written; and you could never really predict where it was going - again, I loved that! I told a friend at one point that I was only 30% through the book, and already audibly gasped several times. She has this book on her TBR list and I'm telling her to read it ASAP!! I went ahead and ordered the 2nd book before I even finished this one so I could have it to read as soon as I finished this one.",

This was a true fantasy romance with complex worlds, species, and histories.\n\nI loved Dianna. She was such a baddie who was willing to do anything to keep her sister safe and I truly mean anything. She allowed herself to become a monster so that her sister could have a peaceful existence. She was hilarious and irreverent and I loved watched her interactions with Liam because he has no clue what to do with her.\n\nI love a broken man and Liam was BROKEN. The poor guy had suffered for ages reliving the mistakes of his past and pushing away everyone who loved and cared for him. It was only stubborn and exasperating Dianna who was finally able to break him out of his shell.\n\nThe twists and turns in this book had me on the edge of my seat. There were some obvious betrayals that camouflaged the unexpected betrayals. Enemies became friend, friends became enemies. It was fantastic.\n\nMy only complaint was that it started off a little slow. I know that often fantasy books can start off a little slow because there is so much information to get across but that wasn’t the problem. I think Amber explained everything so well. But once Dianna and Liam started reluctantly working together, things really picked up.\n\nI cannot wait to start the next book! That cliffhanger was killer.",

    "synopsis": "She once feared him but now cannot resist him…\n\nAfter decades of violence, the war pitting the human colony on Cibbos against the Yurus tribe has finally ended. Lara never expected that peace between their species would lead to a romantic entanglement with one of their former enemies. Resembling a cross between an orc and a minotaur, Wonjin looks nothing like how Lara had imagined a potential mate. And yet, she cannot deny the attraction she feels.\n\nWhen he finally makes his move, how can she refuse this grumpy, cuddly pile of muscles, with the fluffiest fur and cutest ears?\n\nNOTE: By popular demand, I wrote this novella to detail the romance between Wonjin and Lara, both secondary characters in the book I Married A Minotaur. It is recommended the read book first before this novella for better context.",

        "comment": "I love Regime Abel and and Prime Mating Agency is one of my all time favorite series! This little novella that brought us back to I Married a Minotaur was so good 5 stars are not enough. Wonjin first saw Lara I'm sure that book when his people needed a bit of help with fixing the speeders. Wonjin, might be a Yurus who enjoys battle, but he's also very very Intelligent, especially in the sciences. Lara is as well being an engineer in her own right. Wonjin knows the minute he sees Lara that he wants het to be his and sets out to impress her with not only his strength but his intelligence. Lara, scared at first because of the past bad blood between her people and Wonjin, she doesn't let herself see that he's doing things to gain her attention. When she sees how wonderful he is her heart races head long I to love with her cuddly , smart wonderful Yurus! As always Regarding me Abel does not disappoint. World building is wonderful but its the fantastic and delightful characters that display such heart felt emotion that will keep you coming back for more. I read this book with a smile on my face the whole time it was a pure pleasure and joy to read! Highly recommend!💖🔥🌟🌟🔥💖🔥🌟🔥💖🔥🌟🔥💖",

The second he meets Lara, he knows she’s his future mate and begins pursuing her.\n\n🌟 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: No fluff. No overdrawn plot. This little novella gave me exactly what I needed. Wonjin was adorable and sweet. Lara was smart and independent. I loved that they dated more conventionally and ended up in love. Overall just another 👌 story in this series.\n\n📝 𝗔 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲… This book runs alongside I Married a Minotaur, which was also an excellent read.\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n𝗦𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: 3/5 🌶🌶🌶\n\n🆓️ on KU",

There was so much promise in him that I wanted a Happily Ever After for this wonderful character and Regine delivered beautifully! Knowing despite the odds between their kind, they grew closer and broke boundaries that made people aware of their growing affections and possibilities for a peaceful future together. I love this story and look forward to others from one of my favorite authors. Hats off to Regine Abel!",

I love the yuru meets girl story.love how they got to know each other.love that this was love at first site for Wonjin but Lara took time to get to know him and fall head over heels for this alien.

How could Lara not be head over heels for Wonjin? Lucky girl! I admire Lara for being able to see past the cultural differences, the history between the two colonies. It’s not always an easy thing to do. When she makes her choice, she stands by it, even under pressure. An outstanding story of cooperation, achieved goals, and sweet romance!",

Lara has that scientific mind that also attracted Wonjin, who also has a beautiful mind. Wonjin has to woo Lara, at first, because she is oblivious to him because she is so focused on the project. Rhianna gives Lara the nudge in the right direction. Read On!",

Although I can appreciate the terminology used, it almost seemed too clinical meaning that the diversity of the language and tone seemed artificial at times. I felt it lacked the personal touch.",

Actually the last few books from my TBR list was one worst than the other and I was about to give up reading this type of books ever again. But then I saw this book in an ad and decided to give one more shot. I’m so glad I did! So far the story and the characters are really good. The story flows really nice that when I got to the end of the book I couldn’t believe it was the end already. I’m jumping to the second book hoping is good as this one.",

This one I am really invested in and want to know what happens next! I’m not thinking about the fact there are 3 more books because the story was written in such a way that you got just enjoy without it being too much that you want, no need, more.\n\nI am really hoping the Leo’s get what’s coming to them and we get to see Ayla grow even more she is coming into her own wolf and woman and I am HERE for it 1000%!\n\nIf you love rejected mates, lost packs, zodiac anything and steamy angst read this book !\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5\n🔥🔥🔥/5",
