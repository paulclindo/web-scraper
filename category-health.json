    "synopsis": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * A groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert\n\n\"One of the most important books you'll ever read.\"—Steven D. Levitt, New York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics\n\nWouldn't you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health.\n\nFor all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting.\n\nThis is not \"biohacking,\" it's science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia's aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, readers will discover:\n\n* Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn't tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack.\n* That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging.\n* Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity \"drug\"—and how to begin training for the \"Centenarian Decathlon.\"\n* Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern.\n* Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all.\n\nAging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.",

        "comment": "This 2023 book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” by Peter Attia, M.D. (with acknowledged contributions by others including Bill Gifford) is a wonderful mix of facts, medical advice, personal and family anecdotes and opinions for living a long life that you, your friends, relatives, and medical professionals will enjoy. One main recommendation is to exercise regularly (in specific ways) while avoiding injury. He recommends particular medical tests. The book is worth purchasing and reading to understand how to live a longer healthier life. As an example of the substance and style of this book, Attia writes: “The information and advice presented in this book are not meant to substitute for the advice of your family’s physician or other trained healthcare professionals. You are advised to consult with healthcare professionals with regard to all matters pertaining to you and your family’s health and well-being.”\nAttia writes: “as a surgical resident at Johns Hopkins, I would learn that death comes at two speeds: fast and slow… Ultimately… slow deaths ended up bothering me even more. But this is not a book about death… [but about] longevity… Longevity does not… mean merely notching more and more birthdays as we slowly wither away… In 1900, life expectancy hovered somewhere south of age fifty, and most people were likely to die from “fast” causes: accidents, injuries, and infectious diseases… the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction… Longevity has two components. how long you live… [and] the quality of your years… called healthspan… defined as the period of life when we are free from disability or disease… Death rates from cancer, on the other hand, have hardly budged in the more than fifty years since the War on Cancer was declared, despite hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of… spending on research. Type 2 diabetes remains a raging public health crisis, showing no sign of abating, and Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative diseases stalk our growing elderly population… None of our treatments for late-stage lung cancer has reduced mortality by nearly as much as the worldwide reduction in smoking that has occurred over the last two decades, thanks in part to widespread smoking bans. This simple preventive measure (not smoking) has saved more lives than any late-stage intervention that medicine has devised… Medicine’s biggest failing is [treating] all these conditions… after they are entrenched—rather than before they take root.”\nAttia writes: “The metabolic derangement that leads to type 2 diabetes also helps foster and promote heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease… all “diets” are similar… protein becomes critically important as we age… Exercise is by far the most potent longevity “drug.” No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function. But most… don’t do nearly enough—and exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as good…”\nAttia writes: “there have been two distinct eras in medical history, and [we are] on the verge of a third… Hippocrates’s major contribution was the insight that diseases are caused by nature and not by… the gods… Medicine 2.0 arrived in the mid-nineteenth century with the advent of the germ theory of disease... [and] eradicated deadly diseases such as polio and smallpox… Yet Medicine 2.0 has proved far less successful against long-term diseases such as cancer… lifespans have nearly doubled since the late 1800s, [almost] entirely from antibiotics and improved sanitation... if you subtract out deaths from the eight top infectious diseases… overall mortality rates declined relatively little over the course of the twentieth century… [The goal of] Medicine 3.0—is… to be thriving… throughout the latter half of our lives… Lifespan… is binary: you’re alive, and then you’re dead. It’s final. But before that happens… most people suffer through a period of decline that… is like dying in slow motion… while actual death is inevitable, this deterioration… is less so… If you increase your muscle strength and improve your cardiorespiratory fitness, you have also reduced your risk of dying…”\nAttia writes: “[Exercise] components [are]: strength, stability, aerobic efficiency, and peak aerobic capacity. We want to maintain physical strength, stamina, stability across a broad range of movements, while remaining free from pain and disability… exercise [is] the most potent longevity “drug” in our arsenal, in terms of lifespan and healthspan. The data are unambiguous: exercise not only delays actual death but also prevents both cognitive and physical decline, better than any other intervention…”\nAttia writes: “data comes from studies of… people who have lived to the age of one hundred and beyond, often in good health… many of them get to enjoy one, or two, or even three Bonus Decades…. Researchers… [found that] individuals [had] very little in common with one another genetically… Natural selection has endowed us with genes that work beautifully to help us develop, reproduce, and then raise our offspring [but] after the age of reproduction, natural selection loses much of its force… [Yet] a handful of potential longevity genes… are possibly relevant to our strategy. One [gene]… called … APOE (apolipoprotein E) that is involved in cholesterol transport and processing, and it has three variants: e2, e3, and e4… The e2 variant of APOE… seems to protect its carriers against dementia—and it also turns out to be very highly associated with longevity… FOXO3 belongs to a family of “transcription factors,” which regulate how other genes are expressed—meaning whether they are activated or “silenced.”… When FOXO3 is activated, it in turn activates genes that generally keep our cells healthier. It seems to play an important role in preventing cells from becoming cancerous as well.”\nAttia writes: “gene expression can be influenced by your environment and your behaviors… a 2007 study found that older people who were put on a regular exercise program shifted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression after six months. This suggests that genetics and environment both play a role in longevity and that it may be possible to implement interventions that replicate at least some of the centenarians’ good genetic luck… think of centenarians as the results of a natural experiment that tells us something important about living longer and living better… The experiment entails taking a random collection of human genomes and exposing them to a variety of environments and behaviors. The centenarians possess the correct combination of genome X required to survive in environment Y (perhaps with help from behaviors Z).”\nAttia writes: “Protein aggregates have been implicated in diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, so getting rid of them is good; impaired autophagy has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease… and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders… By cleansing our cells of damaged proteins and other cellular junk, autophagy allows cells to run more cleanly and efficiently and helps make them more resistant to stress… The FDA has given the green light for a clinical trial of another drug with potential longevity benefits, the diabetes medication metformin… studies appeared to confirm… that patients on metformin appeared to have a lower incidence of cancer than the general population… diabetics on metformin actually lived longer than nondiabetics[striking!].”\nAttia writes: “In the late 1970s, the average American adult male weighed 173 pounds. Now the average American man tips the scale at nearly 200 pounds… According to the [CDC] more than 40 percent of the US population is obese… another third… is overweight (BMI of 25 to 30)… visceral fat is linked to increased risk of both cancer and cardiovascular disease… fat-storage capacity seems to be influenced by genetic factors… our metabolism, as it has evolved over millennia, is not equipped to cope with our ultramodern diet, which has appeared only within the last century or so… We needed to… endure periods of time without much food, and natural selection obliged, endowing us with genes that helped us conserve and store energy in the form of fat… to survive periods of famine, cold climates, and… illness and pregnancy.”\nAttia writes: “At some point, our primate ancestors underwent a random genetic mutation that effectively switched on their ability to turn fructose into fat… This newfound ability to store fat enabled them to survive in the colder climate… But in our modern world, this fat-storage mechanism has outlived its usefulness… It is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples, for example, because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly, mixed with fiber and water, and [we] can handle it normally… I test my patients’ levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure… While heart disease is the most prevalent age-related condition, it is also more easily prevented than either cancer or Alzheimer’s disease… atherosclerotic disease… still kills more people than cancer in the [US] each year… Heart disease remains our deadliest killer, … [but] this should be the tenth leading cause of death, not the first.”\nAttia writes: “The reason they’re called high-and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) has to do with the amount of fat relative to protein that each one carries... it’s not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which it’s transported… Another major misconception about heart disease is that it is somehow caused by the cholesterol that we eat in our diet… The humble egg… has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades, even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol (and particularly egg consumption) may not have much to do with heart disease at all… The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells… dietary guidelines finally… conceded (in 2015) that “cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.” Glad we settled that… the American Heart Association guidelines still favor LDL-C testing instead of apoB. I have all my patients tested for apoB regularly, and you should ask for the same test the next time you see your doctor… We are fortunate that many of these conditions can be modulated or nearly eliminated—including apoB, by the way—via lifestyle changes and medications… I take a very hard line on lowering apoB, the particle that causes all this trouble. (In short: get it as low as possible, as early as possible.)… if we all maintained the apoB levels we had when we were babies, there wouldn’t be enough heart disease on the planet for people to know what it was… In my clinical experience, about a third to half of people who consume high amounts of saturated fats… will experience a dramatic increase in apoB particles, which we obviously don’t want. Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect... The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile… But for many patients... lowering apoB… cannot be accomplished with diet alone... Statins are far and away the most prescribed class of drugs for lipid management... statins… are very helpful drugs for reducing apoB or LDL concentration in many patients... For people who can’t tolerate statins, I [prescribe] bempedoic acid (Nexletol),”\nAttia writes: “Like heart disease, cancer is a disease of aging. That is, it becomes exponentially more prevalent with each decade of life… there were more cancer deaths among people between forty-five and sixty-four than from heart disease… The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited… surgery is of limited value when cancer has metastasized, or spread. Metastatic cancers can be slowed by chemotherapy, but they virtually always come back… Cancer cells… stop listening to the body’s signals that tell them when to grow and when to stop growing… a gene called PTEN, which normally stops cells from growing or dividing (and eventually becoming tumors), is often mutated or “lost” in people with cancer, including about 31 percent of men with prostate cancer and 70 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer. Such “tumor suppressor” genes are critically important to our understanding of the disease… not only is breast cancer genetically distinct from colon cancer (as the researchers expected), but no two breast cancer tumors are very much alike… With a few exceptions… solid organ tumors typically kill you only when they spread to other organs… Prostate cancer kills only when it becomes metastatic… Once cancer has spread, the entire game changes… excess weight is a leading risk factor for both cancer cases and deaths, second only to smoking… Obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers… [For] colorectal cancer (CRC)… About 70 percent of people who are diagnosed with CRC before the age of fifty have no family history or hereditary conditions linked to the disease… Of all the Horsemen, cancer is probably the hardest to prevent”\nAttia writes: “In the [US], about 6 million people are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease… 1 million have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s... Exercise is the only intervention shown to delay the progression of Parkinson’s… Having type 2 diabetes doubles or triples your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, about the same as having one copy of the APOE e4 gene… APOE e4… seems to accelerate other risk factors and driver mechanisms for Alzheimer’s… Curiously, APOE e4 was not always a bad actor… The e3 mutation showed up about 225,000 years ago, while e2 is a relative latecomer, arriving only in the last 10,000 years… In environments where infectious disease was a leading cause of death, APOE e4 carriers may have been the lucky ones, in terms of longevity… The single most powerful item in our preventive tool kit is exercise… Strength training is likely just as important… I now tell patients that exercise is… the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit… Sleep is also a very powerful tool against Alzheimer’s disease... Sleep disruptions and poor sleep are potential drivers of increased risk of dementia… There is a growing body of research linking oral health… with overall health… The conundrum we face is that our environment has changed dramatically over the last century or two, in almost every imaginable way—our food supply and eating habits, our activity levels… Our genes no longer match our environment. Thus, we must be cunning in our tactics…to… thrive”\nAttia writes: “exercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your life… even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years. It delays the onset of chronic diseases, pretty much across the board, but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan… So if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book, it must be in the realm of exercise…”\nAttia writes: “each of us needs to be training for the Centenarian Decathlon… [Decide on] the ten most important physical tasks you will want to be able to do for the rest of… your life… [Consider a] long list of physical tasks that might include some of the following: Get up off the floor under your own power… Lift a twenty-pound suitcase into the overhead compartment of a plane… [from say] more than fifty different items.... [then] select which of these tasks [you] want to be able to perform… in [your] ninth… decade. [then] come up with a list of ten… to become a different sort of athlete altogether: an athlete of life… I structure my training around exercises that improve the following… Grip strength… to be able to lift the weight up and put it back down, slowly and with control… Pulling motions… Hip-hinging movements... I focus on these four foundational elements of strength because they are the most relevant to our Centenarian Decathlon… studies suggest that grip strength—literally… how hard you can squeeze something with one hand—predicts how long you are likely to live… It’s not about telling you what to eat; it’s about figuring… out what works for your body and your goals—and, just as important, what you can stick to…”\nAttia writes: “Nutrition is relatively simple.... don’t eat too many calories, or too few; consume sufficient protein and essential fats; obtain the vitamins and… minerals you need; and avoid pathogens… Beyond that, we know relatively little with complete certainty. Read that sentence again, please… a lot of the old cliché expressions are probably right: If your great-grandmother would not recognize it, you’re probably better off not eating… Plants are very good to eat. Animal protein is “safe” to eat. We evolved as omnivores; ergo, most of us can probably find excellent health as omnivores.”\nAttia writes: “some clinical trials have provided some useful bits of knowledge. One of the… clinical trials… show a clear advantage for the Mediterranean diet—or at least, for nuts and olive oil… The study was meant to last six years, but in 2013… halted it prematurely, after just four and a half years, because the results were so dramatic… The group receiving the olive oil had about a one-third lower incidence (31 percent) of stroke, heart attack, and death than the low-fat group, and the mixed-nuts group showed a similar reduced risk (28 percent). It was therefore deemed unethical to continue the low-fat arm of the trial. By the numbers, the nuts-or-olive-oil “Mediterranean” diet appeared to be as powerful as statins…”\nAttia writes: “SAD, the Standard American Diet [is] almost as devastating to most people as tobacco when consumed in large quantities… The farther away we get from the SAD, the better off we will be… The real art… [is] finding the best mix of macronutrients… [and] an eating pattern [that one] can sustain… our four macronutrients: alcohol, carbohydrates, protein, and fat… Alcohol serves no nutritional or health purpose but is a purely hedonic pleasure that needs to be managed. It’s especially disruptive for people who are overnourished... it’s an “empty” calorie source that offers zero nutrition value… chronic drinking has strong associations with Alzheimer’s disease, mainly via its negative effect on sleep… it loosens inhibitions around other kinds of food consumption…”\nAttia writes: “Many studies have found powerful associations between insufficient sleep (less than seven hours a night, on average) and adverse health outcomes ranging from increased susceptibility to the common cold to dying of a heart attack… As important as sleep is for the body, it may even be more so for the brain. Good sleep, in terms of not only quantity but quality, is critical to our cognitive function… there is a growing body of evidence that sleeping well is essential to preserving our cognition as we age and staving off Alzheimer’s disease.”",

        "comment": "When we are born, we aren't given an owner's manual. But now we have the book, \"Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity\" by Peter Attia, MD. It provides direction for how we can live a long and healthy life. But it also shares a prescription for the things we need to do if we want to live longer despite the diseases that are out to get us, including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes\n\nAttia is well known for his medical advice on his podcast and in other venues. This book cautions us about what he calls the \"four horsemen\" of diseases that are likely to kill us: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction. Despite limited progress in holding some of them back, Attia says modern medicine is still not very helpful until a disease is diagnosed before help is provided. \"Someone who drops dead of a heart attack did not just get sick an hour earlier,\" he writes. \"The disease was working inside them, silently and invisibly, for decades. Their internal defense mechanisms weakened as they grew older, and disease gained the upper hand. \"\n\nAmong the key takeaways from the book:\n\n• Current medicine relies on two tactics: procedures (e.g., surgery) and medications. But he suggests that future medicine should focus on five domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules, meaning drugs, hormones, or supplements.\n\n• According to research by Thomas Perls of Boston University and his colleagues, who run the New England Centenarian Study, one in five people in the general population will have received some type of cancer diagnosis by age seventy-two. Similarly, one-quarter of the general population will have been diagnosed with clinically apparent cardiovascular disease by age seventy-five; among centenarians, that prevalence is reached only at age ninety-two.\n\n• When centenarians die, they have generally (though not always) been sick or disabled for a much shorter period than people who died two or three decades earlier.\n\n• According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 40 percent of the US population is obese (defined as having a BMI[*2] greater than 30), while roughly another third is overweight (BMI of 25 to 30). Statistically, being obese means someone is at greater risk of chronic disease, so a lot of attention is focused on the \"obesity problem,\" but I take a broader view: obesity is merely one symptom of an underlying metabolic derangement, such as hyperinsulinemia, that also happens to cause us to gain weight.\n\n• Doctors should focus on metabolical obesity defined in terms of the following five criteria: high blood pressure (>130/85), high triglycerides (>150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women) central adiposity (waist circumference >40 inches in men or >35 in women) elevated fasting glucose (>110 mg/dL)\n\n• If you meet three or more of these criteria, you have the metabolic syndrome—along with as many as 120 million other Americans, according to a 2020 article in JAMA. About 90 percent of the US population ticks at least one of these boxes.\n\n• Metabolism is how we take nutrients and break them down for use in the body. Those nutrients are processed and sent to their proper destinations in someone who is metabolically healthy. But when someone is metabolically unhealthy, many calories they consume end up where they are not needed, at best—or outright harmful, at worst.\n\n• Fat also begins to infiltrate your abdomen, accumulating in between your organs.\n\n• Patients with diabetes have a much greater risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias; one could argue that diabetes with related metabolic dysfunction is one thing that all these conditions have in common. \"This is why I place such emphasis on metabolic health and why I have long been concerned about the epidemic of metabolic disease not only in the United States but worldwide.\"\n\n• Humans have a unique capacity for turning calories from fructose into fat. Lots of people like to demonize fructose, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, without really understanding why it's supposed to be so harmful. The story is complicated but fascinating. The critical factor here is that fructose is metabolized differently from other sugars. When we metabolize fructose, along with certain different types of foods, it produces large amounts of uric acid, best known as a cause of gout but also associated with elevated blood pressure.\n\n• Cholesterol is essential to life. It is required to produce some of the most critical structures in the body, including cell membranes; hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol; and bile acids, which are necessary for digesting food.\n\n• The humble egg, in particular, was singled out in a 1968 proclamation by the American Heart Association, accused of causing heart disease because of its high cholesterol content. It has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades, even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol (and particularly egg consumption) may not have much to do with heart disease at all. Eating lots of saturated fat can increase levels of atherosclerosis-causing lipoproteins in blood, but most of the actual cholesterol that we consume in our food ends up being excreted out our backsides. The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells. Nevertheless, US dietary guidelines warned Americans away from consuming foods high in cholesterol for decades, and nutrition labels still inform American consumers about how much cholesterol is contained in each serving of packaged foods.\n• cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, right behind heart disease. Together, these two conditions account for almost one in every two American deaths. The difference is that we understand the genesis and progression of heart disease fairly well, and we have some effective tools with which to prevent and treat it. As a result, mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease have dropped by two-thirds since the middle of the twentieth century. But cancer still kills Americans at almost exactly the same rate as it did fifty years ago. We have made some progress against a few specific cancers, notably leukemia (especially childhood leukemia, as I noted earlier). For adults with leukemia, ten-year survival rates nearly doubled between 1975 and 2000, leaping from 23 percent to 44 percent. Survival rates for Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have increased as well, especially the former. Yet these represent relatively small victories in a \"war\" that has not gone particularly well.\n\n• The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited. Many (though not all) solid tumors can be removed surgically, a tactic that dates back to ancient Egypt. Combining surgery and radiation therapy is pretty effective against most local, solid-tumor cancers. But while we've gotten fairly good at this approach, we have essentially maxed out our ability to treat cancers this way. We are not getting any more juice from the squeeze.\n\n• I advocate early, aggressive, and broad screening for my patients—such as colonoscopy (or other colorectal cancer screening) at age forty, as opposed to the standard recommendation of forty-five or fifty—because the evidence is overwhelming that it's much easier to deal with most cancers in their early stages. I am also cautiously optimistic about pairing these tried-and-true staples of cancer screening with emerging methods, such as \"liquid biopsies,\" which can detect trace amounts of cancer-cell DNA via a simple blood test.\n\n• Five decades into the war on cancer, it seems clear that no single \"cure\" is likely to be forthcoming. Rather, our best hope likely lies in figuring out better ways to attack cancer on all three of these fronts: prevention, more targeted and effective treatments, and comprehensive and accurate early detection.\n\n• But what causes cancer to spread? We don't really know, and we are unlikely to find out anytime soon because only about 5 to 8 percent of US cancer research funding goes to the study of metastasis. Our ability to detect cancer metastasis is also very poor, although I do believe we are on the verge of some key breakthroughs in cancer screening,\n\n• Right now, this usually means chemotherapy. Contrary to popular belief, killing cancer cells is actually pretty easy. Traditional chemotherapy occupies a fuzzy region between poison and medicine.\n\n• Globally, about 12 to 13 percent of all cancer cases are thought to be attributable to obesity. Obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers, including pancreatic, esophageal, renal, ovarian, and breast cancers, as well as multiple myeloma (see figure 7). Type 2 diabetes also increases the risk of certain cancers, by as much as double in some cases.\n\n• If the first rule of cancer is \"Don't get cancer,\" the second rule is \"Catch it as soon as possible.\"\n\n• Alzheimer's disease is perhaps the most difficult, most intractable of the Horsemen diseases. We have a much more limited understanding of how and why it begins, and how to slow or prevent it, than we do with atherosclerosis.\n\n• While female Alzheimer's patients outnumber men by two to one, the reverse holds true for Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's, both of which are twice as prevalent in men. Yet Parkinson's also appears to progress more rapidly in women than in men, for reasons that are not clear.\n\nFinally, the author suggests how medicine needs to change it focus:\n\n• The first is exercise, which I consider to be by far the most potent domain in terms of its impact on both lifespan and health span.\n• Next is diet or nutrition—or as I prefer to call it, nutritional biochemistry.\n• The third domain is sleep, which has gone underappreciated by Medicine 2.0 until relatively recently.\n• The fourth domain encompasses a set of tools and techniques to manage and improve emotional health.\n• Our fifth and final domain consists of the various drugs, supplements, and hormones that doctors learn about in medical school and beyond.",

        "comment": "I previously wrote this review right after reading the book. Today, February 15th, after applying James’s system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.\n\nI will divide the review into 5 parts. The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes. Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits. Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months. Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book. Last, there are 4 complementary readings.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[Introduction] James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school. That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that “we all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you will end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.”\n\n[Section I : The Fundamentals]\n\n[Chapter 1] Here we learn the power of compounding effect: changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years. James explains that “breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.” Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks. From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.\n\n[Chapter 2] Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change model—divided into outcome change, process change, and identity change—James explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values. “Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.” The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.\n\n[Chapter 3] In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward. James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'. He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior—when the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible. Through examples, he explains that “the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.” Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.\n\n[Section II : Make It Obvious]\n\n[Chapter 4] A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes. Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded. If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues. James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'—a simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis. We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit. Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.\n\n[Chapter 5] The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location. When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through. Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage. An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: “after I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.”\n\n[Chapter 6] This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors. “Given that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.” To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.\n\n[Chapter 7] One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. As James points out, “it is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.”\n\n[Section III : Make It Attractive]\n\n[Chapter 8] James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine. It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action. “Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.”\n\n[Chapter 9] “We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.” That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues. There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe. And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.\n\n[Chapter 10] To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive. “Habits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.”\n\n[Section IV : Make It Easy]\n\n[Chapter 11] “All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.” The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.\n\n[Chapter 12] Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy. By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. “You don't actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.” That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.\n\n[Chapter 13] There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day. As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one. To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action. “A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy. What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.” He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning. Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.\n\n[Chapter 14] In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place. There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior. [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future. James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen. [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.\n\n[Section V : Make It Satisfying]\n\n[Chapter 15] We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time. “The human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.” For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.\n\n[Chapter 16] Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits. The immediate satisfaction it delivers—as mentioned earlier in Chapter 15—is one of the many benefits that standout. Besides that, James says, “when we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.” The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine. One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows: “If you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.”\n\n[Chapter 17] In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful. A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability: “It is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.”\n\n[Section VI : Advanced Techniques]\n\n[Chapter 18] We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities. “One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.” James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.\n\n[Chapter 19] When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest. The ‘Goldilocks Rule’ states that \"humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.”\n\n[Chapter 20] One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors. To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance. Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that “the process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.”\n\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS\n\nReading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details. In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits. Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the book—following the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.\n\n[1] The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period. A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month. Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.\n\n[2] The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month. In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.\n\n[3] Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high. It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives. Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS\n\n[Nov 1, 2018] I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened. Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journal—a daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time. Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle. Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit. During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.\n\n[Dec 1, 2018] I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement. Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands. But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis. Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method. This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.\n\n[Jan 1, 2019] By now we know the benefits of cold showers—ranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world. I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a “goal” mindset instead of a “habit” mindset. After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode. Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers. After all, it is about intention. Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories. One of my inspirations was Wim Hof. It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.\n\nPutting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day. While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n[1] First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.\n\n[2] However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.\n\n[3] Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.\n\nCOMPLEMENTARY READINGS\n\n[1] Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next. The book is divided into 46 laws.\n\n[2] Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most. This is especially interesting to break bad habits.\n\n[3] The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely. I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talent—which is perhaps even more to the point.\n\n[4] The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated. It is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement Atomic Habits especially to tie together the 4-step framework into the feedback loop system.\n\nI sincerely hope you, too, have fun while building new habits.\n\nTake care,\n\nHaical",

Instead, it offers actionable strategies, a pivot from the norm that significantly influenced my approach to habit formation. Its emphasis on the power of compound growth resonates deeply, bridging the gap between mere knowledge and its practical application.\n\n💡🌙 **Micro Changes, Macro Impacts**: Illuminating the potential of the minuscule: One of the standout features of the book is its emphasis on small changes leading to profound impacts over time. This concept is relatable, especially for those who've faced the daunting task of overhauling their lifestyles overnight. It’s these minor tweaks, consistently applied, that can shape destiny, a theme consistently echoed throughout the book.\n\n📚🎒 **Science Meets Anecdote**: A Blend of Research and Real-Life Stories: James Clear masterfully intertwines scientific research with personal anecdotes, painting a comprehensive picture of habit formation. This duality provides both a theoretical foundation and relatable stories, enhancing the book's credibility and readability.\n\n🕶️🖐️ **Crisp Presentation Coupled with Engaging Narration**: A Treat for Avid Readers: The coherent structure and lucid style of \"Atomic Habits\" are commendable. But the true gem is its captivating narrative, which ensures readers are glued from start to finish. It feels less like a study of habits and more like an enlightening conversation with a trusted friend.\n\n🔋⏱️ **Sustained Motivation as the Central Theme**: The Powerhouse of Habitual Evolution: The recurring theme of maintaining motivation is a testament to the book's holistic approach. By focusing on systems over goals, it provides readers with a blueprint for long-term success, making transient motivation bursts a thing of the past.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of a well-rounded review, I'd like to touch upon a minor observation:\n\n⚖️🤔 **Overemphasis on Certain Concepts**: Repetition for Reinforcement, or Redundancy?: While the recurring themes reinforce the book's core concepts, there are instances where certain ideas felt slightly overemphasized. While some readers might find this repetition helpful, others might see it as a tad redundant.\n\nConsidering everything, \"Atomic Habits\" overwhelmingly earns its 5-star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. Any minor repetitiveness pales in comparison to the goldmine of insights this book offers. The meticulous research, relatable anecdotes, and actionable strategies make it a must-read.\n\nTo all individuals eager for personal growth and those on the fence about diving into the realm of habits, I wholeheartedly endorse \"Atomic Habits\". It promises transformative insights and practical tools to craft a better version of oneself. After all, don't we all seek a life of improvement, one habit at a time?\n\nI extend my deepest thanks to you for investing your time in this comprehensive review. I trust it aids in your decision-making journey, drawing you a step closer to finding your perfect self-improvement guide. To a future enriched with continuous growth, one habit at a time. Dive in, evolve, and thrive! 📚💫🌍",

    "synopsis": "New York Times Bestseller\n\nEverything I Know About Love now streaming on Peacock! \n\n\"There is no writer quite like Dolly Alderton working today and very soon the world will know it.” —Lisa Taddeo, author of #1 New York Times bestseller Three Women\n\n“Dolly Alderton has always been a sparkling Roman candle of talent. She is funny, smart, and explosively engaged in the wonders and weirdness of the world. But what makes this memoir more than mere entertainment is the mature and sophisticated evolution that Alderton describes in these pages. It’s a beautifully told journey and a thoughtful, important book. I loved it.” —Elizabeth Gilbert, New York Times bestselling author of Eat, Pray, Love and City of Girls\n\nThe wildly funny, occasionally heartbreaking internationally bestselling memoir about growing up, growing older, and learning to navigate friendships, jobs, loss, and love along the ride\n\nWhen it comes to the trials and triumphs of becoming an adult, journalist and former Sunday Times columnist Dolly Alderton has seen and tried it all. In her memoir, she vividly recounts falling in love, finding a job, getting drunk, getting dumped, realizing that Ivan from the corner shop might just be the only reliable man in her life, and that absolutely no one can ever compare to her best girlfriends. Everything I Know About Love is about bad dates, good friends and—above all else— realizing that you are enough.\n\nGlittering with wit and insight, heart and humor, Dolly Alderton’s unforgettable debut weaves together personal stories, satirical observations, a series of lists, recipes, and other vignettes that will strike a chord of recognition with women of every age—making you want to pick up the phone and tell your best friends all about it. Like Bridget Jones’ Diary but all true, Everything I Know About Love is about the struggles of early adulthood in all its terrifying and hopeful uncertainty.",

    "synopsis": "How many times have you missed out on something that could have changed your life, all because you were too afraid? Is the fear of failure making you procrastinate? Is your perfectionism stopping you from taking action? Then you need to keep on reading...\n\nMistakes and failures often leave us with feelings of unworthiness. Thoughts such as \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'm not smart enough\" flood our minds. Why do we judge ourselves so harshly? Everyone experiences failure at some point in their life.\n\nBut in our society, success is celebrated, while failure is considered something that we need to stay away from.\n\nShould failure be something we're embarrassed about, something that makes us feel worthless?\n\nKnowing how to handle failure makes a massive difference when it comes to our mental health and our capability to get back on our feet...\n\nAs an entrepreneur, author, and human being, I'm no stranger to failure; I don't think there's anyone who hasn't experienced it in one way or another, which is why I felt inspired to write this book. I have wasted many years and so many opportunities because I wasn't feeling ready or good enough. Constant worry and self-doubt in my abilities made me feel imprisoned, hopeless, and miserable. I was trapped in awful imaginary scenarios. Fear held me back more than any other obstacle.\n\nI understand how it feels when the voice inside your head always looks for a way to hold you back. But now it's time you start nurturing a new voice: one that reminds you that you're good enough and that encourages you to push through when all seems to fall apart.\n\nBetween the pages of this book, you will discover:\n\n\n\nWhere your fear of failure originates from and how to overcome it\n\n\nStories about some of the most successful people in the world and how they handled their failures\n\n\nHow to fight off perfectionism and become an action taker\n\n\nHow to stop self-sabotaging and conquer your procrastination tendencies\n\n\nWhy you shouldn't rely on motivation to get things done and what you can do instead\n\n\nPractical ways to fight off your inner demons: worry and the critical inner voice\n\n\nHow to desensitize yourself from the pain of rejection\n\n\nHow to manage stress, gain inner peace, and become a happier version of yourself\n\nAnd much more...\n\nEven if you dealt with worry, self-doubt, and paralyzing fear since you've known yourself, this book is simple, practical, and here to help you get unstuck.\n\nDon't wait for someone else to change your life. It's time to overcome your fear of failure, stop procrastinating, and fight perfectionism now!",

I wanted to bring more positivity and confidence into my life since I find myself to be a negative over thinker and stress my self out over the little things. This workbook is amazing and is very helpful. I have only dedicated roughly 30 mins into this workbook and I already feel inspired. It actually gets you to think and break down what triggers your insecurities. It gives you tips on how to overcome your insecurities, negative mindset, and how to truly get to know yourself, so you can learn how to love your true authentic self. It encourages you to learn the small details about your self and help you realize how special and rare you are. However, it is so much more than embracing self love!! It’s embracing self love, self compassion, self awareness, body image, healthy relationships, and overcoming challenges/surviving. I highly recommend this workbook!",

I have even been sending copies to friends and recommending it to others. It is so important to be able to have grace for ourselves. To thank our past selves for getting us through hard times when we didn’t have the help we needed. This is not at all a religious book but it has helped me to see myself how God sees me. He doesn’t think of me in the horrible way I’ve been thinking of myself. I needed to learn to love me the way He does and I finally am starting to.

Charming readers, writers, and critics alike, the memoir won the Costa Award for Biography and made Athill, then ninety-one, a surprising literary star.\n\n\n\n\nDiana Athill was one of the great editors in British publishing. For more than five decades she edited the likes of V. S. Naipaul and Jean Rhys, for whom she was a confidante and caretaker. As a writer, Athill made her reputation for the frankness and precisely expressed wisdom of her memoirs. Writing in her ninety-first year, \"entirely untamed about both old and new conventions\" (Literary Review) and freed from any of the inhibitions that even she may have once had, Athill reflects candidly, and sometimes with great humor, on the condition of being old—the losses and occasionally the gains that age brings, the wisdom and fortitude required to face death. Distinguished by \"remarkable intelligence...[and the] easy elegance of her prose\" (Daily Telegraph), this short, well-crafted book, hailed as \"a virtuoso exercise\" (Sunday Telegraph) presents an inspiring work for those hoping to flourish in their later years.",

She calls herself an achiest. This was crystallized by the comment of a casual lover many years ago: \"...might not be that beginnings and endings are things we think in terms of simply because our minds are too primitive to conceive anything else?\"\n\nShe believes after 91 years on earth that to believe in God means \"smallness and boring...even frightening.\" She further concludes, \"People of faith so often seen to forget that the God who gives their lives meaning too often provides them with justification when they want to wipe out other people who believe in other Gods, or in nothing.\" Believers created beliefs, or these Powers, so they could turn to them for direction and control behaviors. \"The mechanism was a obviously necessary one in its time...\"\n\nBut a few sentences later she says, \"Right behavior, to me, is the behavior taught me by my Christian family...I have accepted Christ's teaching partly because it continues to make sense.\"\n\nShe does a great service by sharing the simple truth that we're never too old to learn something new. Nor to old to make new friends in the process. She gives deep space to gardening. Her touching struggles to give up driving, and facing the memories of having to take her own Mother's car away. Her horrific accident where she was spared even a scratch but the fiasco to get her car off the road combined with malfunctioning police radios to her sudden \"general physical malaise\" suddenly resolved in a cup of \"sweet hot tea!\"\n\nSadly to this reader, she settled into life being \"the other woman,\" and takes no accountability for any of these men's failed marriages. I guess when you're in your 90's you find peace where you can.\n\nAnd then there is Barry. She never married the sap, but now he's old and sick and she's stuck. Poor Barry with his penchant for morphine. She's spot-on with the \"humilities of illness.\" Her non-husband ends up on a catheter when his urinary system goes south...and refuses to use the toilet with a nurse, and saves a Mt. Vesuvius blow-out for her to clean, which she does with detachment.\n\n\"She no longer feels the need to ponder human relationships-particularly love affairs.\"\n\nShe claims not to regret being childless, but her story made me sad. She became pregnant at 43 but had a miscarriage, apparently this child's loss in her life nearly killed her, both physically and emotionally. But there was another pregnancy that she terminated \"without hesitation or subsequent unhappiness.\"\n\nShe sums up the experience as believing if she'd had a child she would have been a good mother. And she lives in peace because she \"can't have the hassle of close involvement...\n\nUltimately, after 91 years, she concludes a long life is about luck. Who and where you were born, and in the end dissolve into nothingness. Are lives are just interesting.",

        "comment": "When was the last time you encountered someone new and the word 'wisdom' popped into your head? Not very often lately? Me neither. Until last week. I read right through this book, \"Somewhere Towards the End,\" as soon as I finished reading right through Diana Athill's earlier book, \"Stet.\"\n\nI bought \"Stet\" because it was the memoir of a superb book editor, a job I had done once myself, though not superbly. She had been one of the founders of a small, elite British house and worked with Mailer, Vidal, and Updike to name but three of their stable.\n\nI bought \"Somewhere Towards The End\" because I was wondering what it is like to be old. I knew about arthritis, wrinkles and a sense of irrelevance. Who doesn't? I had been wondering if there was anything more appealing to be said for it. Diana Athill was close to 90 when she wrote this book, and the answer she personifies is 'Yes, there is.'\n\nYou see from the first page that she herself is a wonderful writer, a very unusual writer, and she must have been hell on wheels as an editor. (Not in the way you may be thinking though; Gordon Liss she is not. Her insights are penetrating, but her touch is very light., just short of self- effacing.) She embodies more than a few paradoxes. She she did not bring the kind of clear, rational insights to her own personal and financial life that she invested in her authors' books. She is quite frank about it, but never self-pitying. Fortunately for the reader, she made interesting mistakes with interesting people. One of the things that charmed and fascinated me is how lucidly and candidly she writes about her misadventures.\n\nOne minute she seems quite eccentric and the next you may realize that you've done the same thing for the same reason but never quite admitted the latter to yourself. She is extremely discrete about the affairs of others but not at all politically correct about her own sexual history. Nor does she romanticize the emotional history that went along with it. And outlives it.\n\nI hope I have done this book and this writer justice. She has had a real impact on the way I look at some things, and I hope many others will get the same opportunity.",

        "comment": "I think what I liked best about this book is its absolute frankness. Athill has nothing to hide. She knows she has done certain things in her life that are perhaps less than admirable or honorable, and that she can be, and often is, quite selfish. So what? She cites the example of 103 year-old Alice Herz-Sommer, also a professed atheist, who said -\n\n\"We are born half good and half bad - everybody, EVERY body. And there are situations where the good comes out and where the bad comes out. This is why people invented religion, I believe.\"\n\nAthill does admit to having some regrets, but refuses to dwell on them. She is simply grateful for the life she has had and amazed that she's lucky enough to still be here. Which makes sense to me.\n\nAfter more than fifty years as an editor in the publishing business, Athill became a successful memoirist in her seventies and eighties. And she makes no bones about her joy at this: \"... easily the best part of my old age has been, and still is, a little less ordinary. It is entirely to do with having had the luck to discover that I can write.\"\nShe goes on to tell how much enjoyment she has gotten from her late-found celebrity, however minor it might be. Having published my own first book at the age of sixty (and three more since then), I can relate. It's been a kick. This is a fascinating little book about growing old, and not at all sad or negative. I'm glad I found it, and plan to pass it along now to my mother, who at 93, is a year older than Diana Athill. I'm sure she'll like it too. Who knows, maybe it will nudge her into writing more about her own life. I hope so. Go for it, Mom. - author of the REED CITY BOY trilogy and LOVE, WAR & POLIO",

    "synopsis": "“Incredibly rich with wisdom and insight that will leave the reader, whether single or married, feeling uplifted.” —The Washington Times\n\nBased on the acclaimed sermon series by New York Times bestselling author Timothy Keller, this book shows everyone—Christians, skeptics, singles, longtime married couples, and those about to be engaged—the vision of what marriage should be according to the Bible.\n\nModern culture would have you believe that everyone has a soul mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that your spouse is there to help you realize your potential; that marriage does not mean forever, but merely for now; and that starting over after a divorce is the best solution to seemingly intractable marriage issues. But these modern-day assumptions are wrong. Timothy Keller, with insights from Kathy, his wife of thirty-seven years, shows marriage to be a glorious relationship that is also misunderstood and mysterious. The Meaning of Marriage offers instruction on how to have a successful marriage, and is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life.",

        "comment": "What do I think of Tim and Kathy Keller's book published by Riverhead? Let's plunge into the Deeper Waters and find out.\n\nThis is the second Tim Keller book I've read and like the first one, I loved it and I hated it. I loved it because it's just packed with excellent information and wisdom to help one be a good spouse and learn to appreciate marriage all the better. I hated it because in the midst of all of this, the Kellers smack you right between the eyes with what they've written so you have to take a good long look in the mirror and come to the conclusion that there are ways that you don't shape up as the spouse that you are to be.\n\nTim Keller is the pastor of a church with thousands of people in New York and the overwhelming majority of those people are single, quite the rarity. Despite that, this book is based on a sermon series he did on marriage. Sermons on marriage are not just for married people. They need to be there for singles as well. Why? Because many of those singles just might want to get married someday and they need to learn to honor marriage the way God intended. If they don't, they still need to honor marriage, such as avoiding having sex with other people, because they will be interacting with married people and even if you are not married, you can still work to build up the institution of marriage.\n\nAt the start, the Kellers want to dismiss with the idea of a Hallmark card. Marriage is usually treated like a fairy tale where you live your life feeling constant love for the other person. However, if this was what marriage was meant to be, then very few marriages would last. In fact, it could be the reason that many marriages do not last is because there are too many people who expect this. C.S. Lewis once wrote that the feeling of being in love is the explosion that gets the relationship started, but after awhile, it has to learn to rely on a deeper love that does not depend on the feelings.\n\nThe Kellers also give a history of marriage and show how in the Enlightenment, marriage came to be about fulfilling your own needs and not so much about self-denial. It came about fulfilling yourself as a person emotionally and sexually. Each person was entering more often for what the marriage would do for them and not what it would do for the other person. What a shock then that we wind up in a scenario where if the other person is not meeting our needs, well we just walk right out the door. Unfortunately, when we do this, we don't realize that many of the problems from the marriage we still take with us and we just bring them into our next relationship, and then we probably bring even more since we're trying to recover from a past relationship.\n\nTim Keller says that as a pastor, he points out to people that love is hard. Most anything that you want to do well, it requires sacrifice and effort. Look at the star athlete in any field. Could they have been born with some natural talent? Absolutely. Yet despite that natural talent, they had to work hard to do what they are doing today. We could in fact argue that love is very hard because it does go against our natural inclinations. Our natural mode of operation is to look to ourselves and take care of our own needs. Marriage calls you out of that to look to the needs of someone else.\n\nThe Kellers contend through their work that marriage is a picture of the Gospel. Of course, you can have a good marriage without knowing the Gospel, but if you know the Gospel well, it will improve your marriage. This is why they say that marriage is painful and wonderful. So is the Gospel. We can all appreciate good news about redemption in Christ and forgiveness, but with that good news comes the message that you are a human being who is not perfect and you are guilty of great wrong and need to seek forgiveness for your sins. We don't like being told we're sinners, and frankly, marriage has a great way of showing you the many things that you are doing wrong. I often tell guys that when you get married, it's like God putting a big mirror in front of you and saying \"Hey! This is what you're really like! Do you like what you see?!\"\n\nThe Kellers point out that at the heart of many divorces is a self-centeredness. You can see this because many times when someone divorces, they will often rail about what a jerk the other person was. Very rarely will they talk about all the things that they did wrong. (This is not to say there are no valid divorces. Sadly, there are.) This is of course our natural tendency. None of us really likes to look in the mirror and see who we are, but I often tell people who are married that the rule I apply in our marriage is when something goes wrong, I try my hardest to first look at myself and see if I did anything wrong. I'd like to say I always succeed at doing this, but I don't.\n\nIronically, if we put the needs of our spouse first and seek their happiness, we can more often find our own happiness. The reality is many of us know this. A wife who provides a good romantic evening for her husband can enjoy the sexual act itself. Yet despite this, the greater joy she will often get out of it is knowing that her husband is going to bed that evening a happy man. (And yes ladies, we will go to bed happy men!) A husband will not normally enjoy spending money, but when he buys his wife some flowers, the great joy that he gets is not from spending the money, but from the joy that he brings his wife. We all know this! Why aren't we living it more?\n\nThe Kellers then go on to speak about the people who ask why a piece of paper should matter so much. Keller says that if you say \"I love you, but let's not ruin it by getting married\", it's a way of saying \"I don't love you enough to close off all my options. I don't love you enough to give myself to you that thoroughly.\" Getting that piece of paper is a public declaration with solid evidence that there is no one else and that all other doors are closed. Yes. The piece of paper does mean something. (Also, the Kellers are strongly against any idea of living together before marriage as that also increases your odds of divorce.)\n\nKeller also talks here about our idea of passion and uses sex as an example. He writes that if you only have sex when you feel a time of great passion, then you will rarely do it and there will be fewer times of great passion as your spouse feels deprived. Why should they try to ask you for sex if they're quite sure they will get a no answer? I happen to agree with those who say that many times someone should have sex even when they don't feel like it. Once again, this is not about your needs. This is about the needs of your spouse. William Lane Craig has emphasized this as well.\n\nThere's also the emphasis on what it means to honor your spouse. Breaking faith with your spouse means breaking it with God. It's a shame that many couples enter the covenant of marriage and before a year is done, they're looking to get out. When you got married, if it was in a church, you made vows to God and you made vows to man and you made vows to each other. Does that not mean anything to you? Those vows, the Kellers point out, are not just a vow of how you feel today, but they are meant to be vows that you will in fact keep loving your spouse in the future as well.\n\nThe Kellers also want us to know that in marriage, our goal is to shape the other person to be all that Christ wants them to be. We don't just love them as they are. We love them as we see them becoming. We love to see what Christ is doing in them. You must be committed to your spouse's holiness. As you do this, you will experience romance, sex, laughter, and fun, but those are not the cause of the great marriage. They are the result of it. The more that you are getting from your relationship with Christ and becoming like Him, the more also you will be able to impart that to your own family.\n\nAside from Christ, your marriage must be first. If your spouse does not think they are being put first, then you are not putting them first. That sounds hard, but it's the truth. What would it mean if you have to convince your spouse that you are their first love? It would mean that you have done something to them to demonstrate to them that you are indeed not their first love. There has been someone or something else invited into the marriage and the person who feels rejected is just drifting into the background. You will not be able to have a great marriage if this is going on.\n\nThe Kellers also write about loving the other, and this in two chapters with Tim writing one first and his wife writing one on being a wife in the relationship. Tim writes about the power to transform, pointing out that he never really felt manly until he married. This is something I can relate to. I never did either, but now that I have a wife, I can fully delight in the masculinity that I do possess. This is also another reason why the sexual component means so much. It is the loudest way that a wife can scream to her husband \"You are my man.\" The rest of the world may look at me and see nothing special, but if Allie is looking at me and saying I am her man and her rock and the one she turns to, then I'm ready to conquer the world at that point.\n\nKeller also writes to never withhold the primary love language. This goes both ways. A wife should not use sex as a weapon, such as punishing her husband by withholding herself when she doesn't get her way. On the other hand, the husbands can often be quite guilty of this when they give the silent treatment.\n\nThe Kellers also have a chapter on the single life and marriage. It's important to realize that if you are single, you are not looking for another Jesus. Your spouse is not supposed to be your savior. That is expecting too much of them. It is tempting to put your spouse in the place of God, but that is a recipe for disaster. Your spouse will not solve all the problems in your life. In fact, your spouse will quite often cause all new problems in your life.\n\nThe last chapter is on sex, and I think this is the way to go. OF course, this is the chapter most of us men want to skip ahead to, but we need to know all about marriage before we get to one of the greatest fruits of marriage. The Kellers write that sex is a covenant making activity. There's a reason why in the bedroom, you will often get the greatest cries of love and passion. It is a passionate time and each person is practically under a spell. Earlier in the book, the Kellers write that it doesn't necessarily start out this way. The Kellers write they were virgins when they married and the first time was frustrating, but like any other skill, it improves over the years. One of the greatest ways to improve it is to focus not on your happiness but on that of your spouse. Don't try to perform. Just love one another. If you love one another, then there will definitely be times in enjoying that sex that you will indeed rock each other's world.\n\nFinally, sex is enjoyable not because it just includes awesome and incredible physical sensations, but because it reflects to the Trinity and the delight that our soul will have before God. Sex is often the closest we get to a moment of true ecstasy and an out-of-body experience in this life. (Is it any wonder some have even said that sex could be used as a proof that God exists?)\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this book by the Kellers. I suspect I will be going through it again sometime, this time with my wife.\n\nIn Christ,\nNick Peters",

        "comment": "What I appreciated most about this book is the author’s deep affection for his wife. Reading through this book, you can tell that they really do cherish each other. It’s refreshing to hear a Pastor honor his wife’s talents while admitting how much he needs her. Timothy Keller writes on page 163, “To my wife, I’m Superman, and it makes me feel like a man in a way nothing else could.”\n\nThat’s what you want to hear in a marriage book. I also appreciated Tim’s brutal honesty with himself, admitting where he’s made mistakes in his marriage and how it took the wisdom of his wife to get him back on the right track.\n\nHe makes some really good points in this book such as—\n\n“If you never express anger, your truth telling probably won’t sink in.” (p. 184)\n\nThen he gives a lot of reasons to avoid sin—but honestly, we only need a simple love for Christ. That’s it. If you really love Christ—that’s enough to keep you on the straight and narrow without all these other reasons getting in the way.\n\nLater on, Pastor Tim has a real powerful insight on problems with the rising trend of Christian courtship trying to replace Christian dating. He writes,\n“There are some evangelical Christian communities that have sought to reestablish the kinds of pathways that were prevalent in former times. Some have proposed a very father directed form of courtship in which a young woman’s father chooses mates and directs the process. I believe that by and large these return to courtship movements are beset with many problems. They don’t take into consideration the idols that were inherent in traditional societies and they each institutionalize one particular moment in human social history.” (p. 235-236)\n\nThat’s a great point. We need to not get stuck on one generation’s methods when the Bible transcends time.\n\nNow about the rest of the book. While I understand where Pastor Tim is coming from on many points he makes—this book is written in such a complicated way that even those of us who can read at a Ph.D. level are left struggling to understand parts of it. Maybe this book was intended as a textbook for a seminary class on Bible theology. Listen to this example and decide for yourself if this is DRY reading—\n\n“Even today’s critics of monogamy must grant that—at least pragmatically—we can’t really live without it. One of the reasons for this is the growing body of empirical research.” (p. 39)\n\nMoving right along…..\n\nThis book continues with some eye-brow raising personal opinions such as\n\n“I’m tired of listening to sentimental talks on marriage.….much of what I’ve heard on the subject has as much depth as a Hallmark card. While marriage is many things, it is anything but sentimental.” (p. 13)\n\n“Marriage used to be a public institution for the common good, and now it is a private arrangement for the satisfaction of the individuals.” (p. 22)\n\n“A pastor is required to befriend a lot of people that he would never otherwise choose as friends.” (p. 108)\n\n“The only way for you to be truly free is to link your feelings to an obligation.” (p. 103)\n\nLet’s clear that one up right now—Jesus said that what sets us free is abiding in His Word.\n\nNow getting back to this book—the author’s main point is that marriage requires constant selfless giving of yourselves to your spouse. Of course—we all agree with that but somehow this book goes so far overboard emphasizing sacrifice that it forgets that Jesus actually said in Matthew 9:13(NIV), “Go and learn what this means—I desire mercy, NOT SACRIFICE.”\n\nLet that sink in for a moment. While Jesus does call us to turn away from the pleasures of the world, take up our cross and follow Him—there’s a huge difference between laying down our lives for Christ and suffering to meet the endless demands of a narcissist spouse.\n\nListen to what God says in Hoshea 6:6(GW)\n“I want your loyalty, not your sacrifices. I want you to know me, not to give me burnt offerings.”\n\n“Watch your step when you enter God’s house. Enter to learn. That’s far better than mindlessly offering a sacrifice, doing more harm than good.” Ecc 5:1(MSG)\n\nThat’s what this book doesn’t understand. While selflessly giving yourself to your spouse is the basic ingredient of marriage—it can’t solve every marriage problem. Yet this book uses sacrifice to solve every marriage problem instead of teaching how to set boundaries to protect people. Then it goes further and says some things that leave you wondering where he’s coming from.\n\nWhen I read pages 59-63, I almost fell out of my chair.\n\nHe writes,\n“There are many reasons that we cannot see our own self-centeredness. One of the main factors that hides it from us is our own history of mistreatment. Many people come to marriage having been seriously hurt by parents, lovers, or former spouses…...Then there are the dating relationships or former marriages in which the other party wronged and betrayed you.” (p. 59-60)\n\n“Woundedness makes us self-absorbed.” (p. 60)\n\n“Woundedness is compounded self-doubt, guilt, resentment, and disillusionment.”\n(p. 60)\n\n“Our hurts and wounds can make our self-centeredness even more intractable.” (p. 61)\n\n“This is not hard to see in others, of course. When you being to talk to wounded people, it is not long before they begin talking about themselves. They’re so engrossed in their own pain and problems that they don’t realize what they look like to others. They are not sensitive to the needs of others. They don’t pick up the cues of those who are hurting or if they do, they only do in a self-involved way……They get involved with others in an obsessive and controlling way because they are actually meeting their own needs though they deceive themselves about this.” (p. 60)\n\n“When you point out selfish behavior to a wounded person, he or she will say…....the wounds justify the behavior.” (p. 61)\n\n“There are two ways to diagnose and treat this condition.….In this (secular) view of things we give wounded people almost nothing but support, encouraging them to stop letting others run their lives, urging them to find out what their dreams are and take steps to fulfill them. That we think is the way to healing. But this approach assumes that self centeredness isn’t natural…...only the product of some kind of mistreatment…..That is a very popular view of many people in the West but this view of things simply doesn’t work.” (p. 61)\n\n“Christian approach…....(is that) we believe that as badly wounded as persons may be, the resulting self-absorption of the human heart was not caused by the mistreatment. It was only magnified and shaped by it. Their mistreatment poured gasoline on the fire and the flame and smoke now choke them but their self-centeredness already existed prior to their woundedness.” (p. 61-62)\n\n“All people need to be treated gently and respectfully, esp. those who have been wounded…….Nevertheless, all people must be challenged to see that their self-centeredness hasn’t been caused by the people who hurt them its only been aggravated by the abuse.” (p. 63)\n\n“The woundedness makes us minimize our own selfishness.” (p. 63)\n\nReading that reminded me of something that happened a while back. One time I was driving down the street when several cars ahead of me—a motorcyclist was hit by a car. Everyone immediately tried to help him. Several people ran over to administer first aid. Others blocked traffic to protect him while he was laying on the pavement. Someone called an ambulance and the paramedics came. To this day, I’ll never forget seeing that poor guy laying broken and bloodied on the pavement—writhing in pain as the paramedics worked on him. Fortunately, they said his injuries weren’t life threatening.\n\nNow picture this for a moment. Imagine that while the motorcyclist is laying in the middle of the street—someone comes over to him and says, “Stop being so selfish. Forget about your injuries. Get on your feet and start taking care of everyone else!”\n\nThat would be heartless and cruel!\n\nBut while Jesus Himself is “touched with the feeling of our infirmity” this book seems to run right over them.\n\nHow does that make God feel? Look at Ezekiel 34:4(GNT)—where God gets REALLY ANGRY at Pastors because they weren’t doing their job. Listen to what God says to the Pastors.\n\n“You have not taken care of the weak ones, healed the ones that are sick, bandaged the ones that are hurt, brought back the ones that wandered off, or looked for the ones that were lost. Instead, you treated them cruelly.”\n\nThink about that for a moment. That passage is describing the role of the Pastor as to\n\n1) Strengthen the weak\n2) Heal the sick\n3) BANDAGE THE HURT\n4) Bring back the ones that wandered away\n5) Look for the ones that were lost\n6) Feed the sheep (see verses 2-3)\n\nJesus Himself came to HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED (Luke 4). NOT hurt them even more. Any Christian theology that doesn’t understand that is missing the Heart of God.\n\nI’m NOT saying that Pastor Tim is doing that—I’m just saying that what he wrote about wounded people opens the door for the abuser to get all the mercy and forgiveness while the real victim gets the guilt and condemnation. This book is so focused on pointing the finger at wounded people that it misses the dynamics of emotional abuse that are causing the wounds in the first place.\n\nNow if you can hang in there a little longer—there’s more stuff in this book that we need to address.\n\nThis book teaches a very controversial doctrine on the Trinity that seems to apply marriage roles to the Trinity. That doesn’t work—unless as Michael Bird wrote—your marriage consists of an older man, a younger man and a eunuch!\n\nThis doctrine is called Eternal Subordination of the Son(ESS). Let’s talk about this for a minute. We all know that when Jesus walked the Earth—He set the example for us of submitting to God’s will. But does that automatically mean that\nthroughout all eternity—both before and after coming to Earth—Jesus was in a subordinate role in the Trinity—meaning that Jesus doesn’t have the same authority as the Father does?\n\nJesus said in Matthew 28:18(NIV) that “ALL AUTHORITY in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” So how could the Father be withholding some authority from Him? THEN there’s John 5:22(NLT) which says, “The Father judges no one. Instead, he has given the Son ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY to judge.”\n\nSo why would ESS be such a big deal? Why would so many strong Complementarians be coming forward with serious concerns about the long-term effects of ESS?\n\nNone of that is discussed in this book. Instead this book acts as though ESS is a commonly accepted mainstream Christian doctrine when in fact it is being highly disputed by many leading Complementarians.\n\nIn this book, Pastor Tim’s wife Kathy explains that ESS had a powerful influence in shaping her worldview. She writes, “When I first heard Christians talk about male and female as “different but equal” it sounded a little too much like the “separate but equal” motto of segregation.” (p. 197)\n\nBut what finally convinced her to accept the idea of roles was ESS because “If our assigned roles are rooted in the nature of the relationships within the Trinity, tampering with the revelation of that mystery that God intends within marriage is surely not our prerogative.” (p. 215)\n\nKathy defines these roles as “women have a gift of interdependence—a receiving gift” (p. 203) while men have a “need for independence.” (p. 206) Where is that verse in the Bible? Didn’t God say that it wasn’t good for men to be alone? This suggests that women are to be passive when Jesus told us to be actively “asking, seeking, and knocking.”\n\nOn page 216 Kathy also defines women’s role as\n“A wife accustomed to resenting every Archie Bunker like behavior of her husband may begin offering her submission with graciousness rather than resenting the lack of honor she receives from her husband.” (p. 216) Hang on a second. What about God’s law of sowing and reaping?\n\nThis is sweeping serious problems in the marriage under the rug—again trying to fix everything by sacrifice when sometimes the only way to make things change is by setting boundaries. Interfering with people’s ability to set boundaries is literally interfering with the Fruit of the Spirit in people’s lives which is self-control. Since the Bible says there’s NO LAW OF GOD AGAINST SELF-CONTROL (Gal 5:23), books that teach people that sacrifice solves everything forget that Jesus gave us the power to decide when to lay our lives down and when to take it up again. (John 10:18) Any Christian teaching that goes against that is going against Scripture.\n\nYet Kathy defends these controversial roles to the point where she writes on page 215 that if your born-again, spirit-filled, Bible-believing CHRISTIAN spouse doesn’t agree with your opinions on theology—you should TREAT THEM AS A NONBELIEVER!!! She literally teaches people to consider themselves as married to a nonbeliever if there’s a difference of opinion in the marriage on Christian theology!\n\nGULP!!!!\n\nTaking these roles even further, on page 306, Kathy says that these roles should determine how society functions as a whole—“including how that affects the relationship of men and women in the church and in the world.”\n\nThat sounds familiar. Where have we heard that before? The more Kathy describes these roles the more it sounds like she’s quoting from the book Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (RBMW), where John Piper actually wrote that women are supposed to feel submissive to EVERY man in EVERY situation even down to “the most casual relationship with a STRANGER ON THE STREET.” (p. 44)\n\nThat even the housewife in her backyard must be submissive when giving directions to a complete stranger so that “neither of them feels their mature femininity or masculinity compromised.” (p. 50)\n\nThat women must avoid any jobs that give them too much direct influence over men in a work environment because that would “OFFEND a man’s good, God-given sense of responsibility and leadership and thus controvert God’s created order.” (p. 51)\n\nWait a minute—he just said that men being “offended” proves that women are disobeying God! Really? Galatians 1:10 says “If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.” Plus, the Proverbs 31 woman didn’t let any of this interfere with her career opportunities!\n\nSo where does he get these crazy ideas? You guessed it—Piper founded the organization which is the driving force behind ESS. What’s really crazy is that if you read that book we just quoted Piper from—the Christian theologians who wrote that book can’t even agree among themselves as to the proper role for women. The chapters in RBMW literally disagree with each other!\n\nThink about what’s happening here. Bible verses on marriage are being applied to the Trinity. Then they’re being applied to the workplace. Then society as a whole. No wonder Complementarians themselves are coming forward with serious concerns about ESS!\n\nPlus, who gets to decide exactly what these roles are? There’s such a huge difference of opinion among Christian theologians on these roles that no matter how hard we try, we will never know if we’re following the role properly or not. That’s why the Bible warns us NOT to add anything to the text. The further down the rabbit hole we go in researching this—the more you see that there’s too many personal opinions being added to Scripture.\n\nMy point is that the further you research—the more you see that ESS has serious implications that need to be addressed by the church as a whole. The fact that both Complementarians and Egalitarians are coming out against ESS should make people pay attention. Besides, Jesus said to pray that God would send more laborers to the harvest, why let ESS shut the door on the gifts and talents of half the body of Christ?\n\nThank you for hanging in there through this long review. It was necessary to address all these issues in this book because we have to get back to the “simplicity of Christ.”\n\nThe bottom line is that ALL Christian theology has to bow its knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ who came to “destroy the works of the devil,” “set the captives free,” and “heal the broken-hearted.” Any theology that misses that is missing the Heart of God.",

Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world’s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain’s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.",

        "comment": "Of all the non-fiction books I've read, this is by far the best one ever. I grew up in a tough way. Lots went wrong. My brother and I believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment. We suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable. When I became an adult, I subscribe to the concepts of people like Rush Limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder. I believed I could gut it out, that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems. I believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure. Frankly, for a time, that approach worked for me. I got married, had some great children (still have them thankfully), built a company. But it didn't take too long until it all came crashing down. And, when it did, I spent nearly 1.5 decades down. The anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was, to put it mildly, a distraction. It's very hard to be kind to people, to focus on your work, to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you don't feel like s***. When you can't sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating - at least it feels that way - you not only lose the joy of sleep, but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when you're not able to understand why you feel this way. When you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time (much to your embarrassment) and yet you think you're smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are, life becomes a slog. You trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if, like me, you'd never kill yourself. Literally, when I was a believer, I went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this, \"Dear Jesus, please have a bus run over me. I will never kill myself but I'm miserable. Please let me die so my family won't hate me for killing myself but so that I can stop hating the sun coming up. In Jesus name, Amen.\" If you're like I was (and it's hard to tell you how I was and hold the tears down even now), this book will help you change all that. It will describe in detail what you're going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing. For the first time, I don't have depression (and I don't take pills). I don't have anxiety (it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness, it goes nearly as fast as it comes). My life is pointed in the right direction, my business future is hopeful, my love-life is stabilizing, I know I'll no longer lose friends. I'm finally on track to getting what I want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family. While I can't attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go (mostly you), I can absolutely attest to the power of this book. If you've suffered any sort of major and/or persistent trauma in your life, please buy (and read) this book. You will one day thank yourself for doing so.",

        "comment": "Psychiatrist, professor, world-class researcher, and traumatologist Bessel van der Kolk MD requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists. My enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance, cogency, frankness, and accessibility - served up with a subtle dash of impishness. He tends to be a bit disruptive - something of a provocateur - and everything of his I have ever read has taught me something, confirmed something important, or pushed my thinking in a new direction. When he has something to say, I want to hear it.\n\nHowever, I almost didn't buy this book: I was put off by the title. Familiar with major reviews of PTSD psychotherapy outcomes research, I know that research support for body-oriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best, and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and PE (Prolonged Exposure), neither of which are especially body-focused.\n\nJ. Interlandi's excellent article anticipating publication of this book - \"A Revolutionary Approach to Treating PTSD\" (New York Times Magazine, 2014.05.22 - available online) - initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der Kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research. \"Psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies,\" Interlandi informs us. Provocateur he may be, but I'm strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation. Our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects - maybe not even if they agree to this, as I'm not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly informed consent. Knowledge that PTSD and related disorders are usually highly curable, when using the right treatment protocols, sadly remains the possession of a minority of people, even in the professional psychotherapy world.\n\nYet the account of van der Kolk's therapy work in Interlandi's article is gripping. Becoming completely absorbed in the account, I was convinced. (I've been here before, reading van der Kolk's own accounts of his work.) And so the disruption begins! Deeper into the article, he has me. Van der Kolk's critique of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy - a general class of therapies) and PE (E. Foa's exposure therapy model) is withering and correct: neither really work. \"Trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognition...It has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous place....It's not something you can talk yourself out of.\" Interlandi reports that \"That view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstream.\"\n\nBut he's right, and I can't stress this enough. Why? Because as a trauma treatment professional I'm well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says. The best current summary of this research well may be chapter 2 of Ecker, et al.'s (2012) \"Unlocking the emotional brain\". (Buy this book, too!) Ecker et al. brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses 11 existing therapy models which actually DO cure trauma psychopathology, if done right. In this context, what van der Kolk is doing makes perfect sense. Finally, it appears, the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibility.\n\nVan der Kolk's new book has many virtues. Parts One and Two (102 pp) provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of trauma's impact on a person. It's fun, interesting, informative reading, for professional and layperson alike. Part Three (64 pp) surveys childhood development, attachment experience, and \"the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma\". Van der Kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of PTSD which substantially differs from all the rest. It develops in response to chronic child abuse and/or neglect. I completely share his belief that the diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (sometimes called C-PTSD, with \"C\" meaning \"Complex\") is overdue for formal recognition. I find his review of the struggle to legitimize DTD as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book. It is anguishing to know that a major problem exists, AND that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it. DTD/C-PTSD is no fantasy. We see and treat these people, as children and adults. They exist, and they are nothing like \"ordinary\" PTSD treatment clients.\n\nPart Four (29 pp) focuses on memory. I've long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point: trauma memory is what causes the problem. Deal with that and the symptoms vanish. Why is this so hard to understand? Yet, it is not a common understanding at all. Explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients. And experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone who's lived with it for years, if not decades. As he does throughout the book, van der Kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what I've seen happen in my clients, making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us: people understand things best through narratives. Offer a good narrative and you convince.\n\nPsychological trauma therapy is complex, but we are now well prepared to launch into the book's core content - Part Five (154 pp), \"Paths to Recovery\". He gets right to it: we cannot undo the trauma, but we CAN undo its effect on us, and so get our \"self\" back. Ch. 13 reviews existing therapies. His approach is to repair \"Descartes' Error\" (see Damásio's 1994 book of that title) by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit. His topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute - not to be missed.\n\nHe then writes of the importance of language (Ch. 14). We construct our narrative mainly in words, and the words we choose are critical. But language is not enough (this anticipates his next two chapters). Our senses encompass a larger world, and it's center is our body, where all our sensory receptors are located. Then he introduces the treatment model he's long advocated: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). I'm trained in EMDR, and in fact van der Kolk and I had the same instructor for our advanced training: Gerald Puk PhD. Van der Kolk tells an amusing and self-deprecating story about his advanced training experience, in which Puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients. This is typical van der Kolk - he's a truth-teller, even when it may put him in a poor light! And,after all, at this point he has nothing to prove to anyone.\n\nFinding an EMDR therapist is not hard (see his \"Resources\" section). Nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor, and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body. Yoga is a wise choice, because it is available, already widely known, and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilities.\n\nThere is much more in Part Five, and the focus is on self-empowerment. \"Victim no more!\" as they say. Most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life - that certainly is my own emphasis. Van der Kolk's thoughts on self-empowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy client.\n\nFor psychotherapy professionals, this book will be both delightful and confirming. For everyone else, it will be a readable, gripping, highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma. That he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate. Our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not, and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated, if at all. This does not have to be. Get educated (this book will do that), then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma. They all deserve the chance to be healed, and we can now do that. Van der Kolk shows us how.\n\nThe physical book: Jacket design is pleasant and interesting. Binding is less so: color of spine wrapping is semi-florescent, and of paper, not cloth. The book feels substantial and pleasant to hold and look at.\n\nOrganization -\n* 6 pp: prefatory praise by peers and related luminaries (interesting comments from some important people in the field);\n* 2 pp: Table of Contents;\n* 356 pp: actual text;\n* 4 pp: Appendix: Consensus proposed criteria for developmental trauma disorder\n* 3 pp: Resources\n* 4 pp: Further reading\n* 51 pp: Notes\n* 21 pp: Index",

The print is messed up in some spots (thankfully ones I don't need) and one page is almost printed into the margins. One of the chapter cover pages was misaligned when the holes were punched.\n\nOverall it's still usable but this quality of printing is disappointing.\n\nUPDATE: I ordered a replacement and it's much better. The tabs are still bent but that's because of the packaging and Ch5's first page is still off printed a bit. The new one is cut perfectly though! All the edges are even this time.",

        "comment": "Among my other writing-related pursuits, I edit PhDs. This APA 7 manual is a big improvement over earlier APA editions.\n\nThe primary purpose of any edition is to update the APA standards. This manual is packed with content and examples that were IMO long overdue. For instance, there are templates to show the order of data for Reference entries, and there are side-by-side examples of Reference and in-text citations.\n\nI ordered the wire-bound version because it works well in any workspace (i.e., you can easily fold the book in half or leave it wide open.\n\nThe chapters are divided by tabs, with the ToC (table of contents) for that chapter printed on the tab.\n\nCompared to earlier versions, the font is smaller, but it remains highly readable. The margins are wide enough for notes.\n\nThere are several downsides to the manual that I hope will be resolved in the next edition:\n\n(a) For such a large manual, the cover on the wirebound copy is both too short and relatively flimsy. It is too short because it is only the width of the pages. It does not extend over the tabs. It is too flimsy because it is the same weight as earlier and less substantial manuals.\n\n(b) There is no tab for the index.\n\n(c) Although the font in the chapters is a sufficient size, the font in the index is much smaller and the index pages are crowded; there is less room in the margins for taking notes.\n\nI dealt with the cover-related problems by cutting up a transparent binder/page sleeve for the front, back, and spine of the cover, and by creating my own tab for the index. There's nothing to be done for the index font except to live with it.\n\nYou can get the gist of what I've reported here by looking at the pictures I've attached.",

        "comment": "“Master Your Emotions” is the best personal development/self-help book I have read, to date. I am a highly intuitive and self-reflective person. I am also an individual who needs to understand why I am the way I am and why I do the things that I do, and I spend a lot of time on personal and psychological introspection in an attempt to become the best me possible. This book was an exceptional read, because the author began with the basics of ‘what emotions are’ and ‘what impacts your emotions’ in parts I and II, before explaining ‘how to change your emotions’ and ‘how to use your emotions to grow’ in parts III and IV. Parts I and II were essential in helping me learn how to ‘master my emotions.’ In learning what emotions are and what affects them, I was then mentally equipped to better understand how I can change my emotions and use them to become the best me possible. As I read this book I was able to spend time journaling on many of the author’s messages and how they specifically apply to my own life. The journaling I have done on the content in this book has served as a great companion to the work I do in therapy. I have been using this book to guide me in understanding my emotions and their affect on my life, and then bringing my thoughts and discoveries to my therapy sessions where my therapist helps me to further develop and understand why I’m experiencing certain emotions and how I can change them to grow as an individual. The discoveries I’ve made because of what I learned in this book have served as a monumental catalyst in my personal development. I highly recommend this book, and I am looking forward to reading other titles by this author!",

This was incredible!\n1st off you HAVE to have read Whiskey Lies and Loving Whiskey to understand a lot of this story even though it takes place before those 2 books. This is Cat and Jay’s story and HOLY $%^!\nThe connection, the angst, the tension, the emotions, the SPICE, just everything was amazing.\n.\nWe’ve long wondered what the deal is between the James and Hanson Families and why there’s so much animosity. WELL we find out in this book right off the bat and it is a DOOZY!\nThen we discover how Cat and Jay meet and form their subsequent relationship. Neither of them know exactly WHO the other is when they first meet and start hanging around each other but when they do they realize this means keeping it a secret from both of their Families obviously since there is not a lot of love lost between the two.\nWhen things start to get serious and they both realize that there are real and true feelings there decisions must be made about how they plan to navigate the future.\nUnfortunately there’s a black cloud hanging over them both…and their families… since revenge and destruction have been the guiding force in one family’s life for a very long time and it is all about to come to a head.\n.\nI really can’t give anything else up b/c SPOILERS and just all of the things that are revealed in this book BLEW my mind! There are subtle little connections to characters and situations in the previous 2 books that make you go HUH? WHAT?!? OH MY GOD! So pay close attention b/c there is A LOT there hiding just below the surface.\nI will say that Jay has jumped up to the #1 spot of Top Book Boyfriends now b/c THAT MAN!! Y’ALL his mouth and the absolute FILTHY things that come out of it are so HOT 🥵 and will make you melt!\nThe spice is next level and the emotions are so raw and real and UGH that ending! I literally FELL to the FLOOR reading the last 2 chapters. I know that Brittanée will MORE than make up for it in the next book in the duet Extra Dirty but I am gonna need therapy until then for sure!",

        "comment": "I just finished both of Jay and Cat’s books back to back, yes, I waited until the duet was complete because I can not live without a full and complete story. I waited and waited for this duet and I gotta say, I am a bit disappointed. It was a lot…and so much of it didn’t make sense. Then so much of it was unfulfilling and not a great HEA. I am so disappointed the way the 2 families didn’t really get it together and absolutely stayed at odds. When they absolutely destroyed the companies then Jays poor brothers were left with crap. And after all the crap that took place even after some truths came out and the grandpa came too, nothing was really resolved. Cat and Jay weren’t able to share their truths with her brothers which was such a disservice to Cash and Cat to be honest. Just yuck. There needed to be a time for all the family to let it all out and work through it together. And I’m sure there might be more books in the future but this was imperative to THIS story.\n\nAnother thing straight out the gate that was an error immediately and throughout the book was the timeline. It states over and over it’s been 13 years they have been apart, yet their daughter is only 11 going on 12 …so was this a 2 year pregnancy like an elephant? How? Also, nothing was shown to as any relationship with the James brothers and Chloe and that is so disappointing. Seriously, your now showing us they are the opposite of what you showed us in Cash’s books. This is definitely a disappointment in their characters for sure, and the entire series. I mean all the bad stuff they had to endure then it just didn’t feel great even after the end.\n\nAlso, I specifically asked if Jay was with others on the authors tik tok page, while they were separated, and was told he absolutely was not. Well, that was a lie and I hated it. Yeah he was celibate for 10 years which made me madder actually. That means for the 3 after he immediately left her he was with all those other women he paraded around with. That’s worse. Like it took away from the supposed love he had for Cat. That took away from so much and made zero sense. He could have faked it for public, why did he have to sleep with them? He was the one who is supposedly crazy in love and irreversible in love with her and doing everything for her ect. Falling into some *&*&$ isn’t for her bro.\n\nAnd how the whole Grace thing went down..no. Just no. I get that they were friends but he knew what that relationship did to her and when he forced her to work with her and told her he loved Grace…in any capacity it was yuck.\n\nAnd poor Chase, like where the heck is he? How did they not tell him the truth? It’s ridiculous at this point. I know it fiction but it is just too unbelievable that nobody gives a crap about him enough to tell him the truth. And the grandpa…we really thought grandma was a real piece of work…ha! Grandpa was the worst. Jay genuinely loved him and thought he had his back and they were working as a team but he really just did it to take Jays company down. And nobody even called him on that betrayal. I dunno I duet a 3.5 at best. Spice maybe a 2.5 or a 3 . It had spicy scenes but they took away from the love story I felt like. Everything about this duet seemed like a big contradiction. 1 minute you want us to feel and think 1 one way then you immediately ruined that but having us see the opposite. It’s like supposedly so much is happening in the story but really nothing happens so it’s all super dragged out and slow. And really it took 13 years? The math ain’t mathing for me.",

        "comment": "** CONTAINS SPOILERS **\n\nthere were so many things to love about this book! having read the whiskey duet and then loving dirty truths, i was dying to have jay’s behavior explained, and extra dirty answered all of my burning questions. i love that jay and cat found their way back to each other.\n\n** SPOILERS **\n\n+ this book made sense of all the things that bothered me in the whiskey duet, which was a relief! i also really liked the unique way that cat stayed involved in her child’s life despite giving her up for adoption.\n\n- i don’t think it’s accurate to say that jay “groveled” to get cat back. did he make an effort? was he pretty wonderful throughout the entire book? yes and yes… but she also resumed a physical relationship with him almost immediately (the tiresome trope of a FMC’s body ~betraying her~) and “forgave” him very quickly after that, so i don’t think i agree that he had to grovel very hard to get her back.\n\nthis book also had one of my other absolute least favorite tropes- a MMC who has sex with multiple women (he did it to “move on”) and a FMC who remains largely celibate (she never has vaginal intercourse with another man because it was something she shared with the MMC and never wanted to experience it with anyone else. she also mentions that she’s too busy with her career to date). i’d hoped those roles would be switched in this book considering jay supposedly spent thirteen years pining for cat and cat spent that time watching him “date” other women after ghosting her. it was extremely disappointing that cat spent 13 years being sexually repressed and jay did not. i found cat to be fairly sexually liberated in the first book, so this part of her story in extra dirty fell very, very flat for me.\n\nthis author has another book in which the FMC fully believes that she walked in on the MMC (her husband) having sex with someone, leaves him, and has still not been seriously involved with or had sex with anyone three years after she left. i would regard this as similar to cat being unwilling to have vaginal intercourse with anyone other than jay. it seems this author might be partial to her FMCs safeguarding their vaginas as an expression of their devotion to the MMCs (who they believe are actually having sex with other women). i won’t get into the internalized misogyny of that. 🥲",

One of the shocking true crimes of passion and greed from Ann Rule's Crime Files.\n\nFormer Marine sergeant and judo instructor Roland Pitre Jr. claimed it was all an elaborate plan to win back his wife's love—it wasn't supposed to end with her dead body in the trunk of a car. Nearly twenty years later, he acknowledged that he had hired someone to kill his estranged wife in 1988, though his alleged excuse for why a monstrous \"mistake\" happened is as shocking and convoluted as the crime itself. Eventually, he was charged with first-degree murder in the long-unsolved death of Cheryl Pitre, after a mysterious witness betrayed Pitre to save his own skin. Tracing back the dark and bloody path of Pitre's life, two generations of detectives found a chain of brutal and terrifying crimes by a man who manipulated the courts and prisons to walk free.",

        "comment": "I often interject myself into my reviews, not because I have a huge ego, but rather, I think that if someone who reads my reviews knows where I'm coming from then he or she will be better able to determine if my opinion has merit for him or her. I mean, if you look at most of my reviews, they're for either true-crime books or true-crime television shows. So if you see that I give a high rating for something and you aren't a fan of the genre then you'll know that my review really won't apply to you. And then you'll move on and consider making a different purchase, even if I give it a recommendation. That is totally fine by me. After all, my review is for you and not for me.\n\nGetting that out of the way, I bought \"Worth More Dead\" (WMD) by Ann Rule for a number of reasons, a few of which I'll list here:\n\n1. Overall I like Ms. Rule's books. There are certainly better true-crime authors -- Jack Olsen comes to mind immediately -- but then again, Ms. Rule was an excellent writer and she rarely if ever made a grammar error. If you read true crime you will know that is a rarity. Unfortunately though, neither Ms. Rule nor Mr. Olsen are with us anymore. So all of the books they'll ever write have presumably already been published. That is certainly a shame.\n2. I used to live in the Seattle area before moving a decade ago to the Bay Area. There are probably five stories in WMD and probably at least three are set in Seattle, or nearby. I usually prefer reading true crime in areas where I live or have lived as it makes it come more alive to me. And since I know the area the story will usually make more sense to me as well.\n3. I used to know one of the detectives listed in one of the stories. I won't say which story and I won't say which detective. But it is the case that I lost track of him right around the time he was investigating a true-crime case in this book and so it added to the story for me as I was able to see what he was up to during those \"lost years.\"\n4. It's not mandatory but I far prefer books in the Kindle format. I can read them on any device I want, I can download them anywhere I am, and it auto-saves bookmarks for me. Plus, I don't have to have a stack of paper backs or hardcovers that continues to build up around the house. Instead I have digital books that \"build up\" on my devices, and they don't \"eat\" very much hard drive or SSD space, which is good.\n\nSo I went into WMD fairly intrigued, and I was motivated to read at a fairly good clip. I got through most of the book in the first few days, and then took my time with the rest of the stories as I had time. Overall, I will say that most if not all of the stories in WMD are beyond interesting, some more so than others.\n\nThe first story is probably the longest and the most complicated. It was beyond intriguing, and it took place in the Seattle area. So far so good for me. In reality though, the story became so complex that my head started to spin. I did think that the criminals involved in the tale spent WAY too much time maybe watching \"Murder She Wrote,\" however. I mean, if you're going to commit crime, without having done it myself, I think the old acronym KISS might be in order: \"Keep it simple stupid.\" These criminals seemingly wanted to commit the most complicated crimes known to man, maybe because they figured it would confuse the police. Well, it did for awhile. Until it didn't.\n\nThere is another story that I found intriguing about a guy that I used to watch on the local news in the Seattle area. He did special-interest stories but unfortunately got himself mixed up in murder and mayhem. That's all that I will write to hold the suspense for you, if you decide to buy and read WMD. The rest of the stories were certainly interesting and weren't just \"page fillers.\" There were interesting enough that I feel Ms. Rule was warranted adding them here.\n\nI will write that \"Worth More Dead\" is surely not the best true-crime book I've ever bought and read. But the stories were very interesting to me, once again, and so overall I'm glad I made the purchase. You? Well, if you like true crime, if you're a fan of Ann Rule, and maybe if you're interested in true-crime stories mostly in the Seattle area it should be right up your alley. And in that case I will give it a fairly strong recommendation for a purchase.",

        "comment": "Ann Rule is the reigning Ruler of True Crime - her forte being in-depth looks at a crime, victims, perps, cops, and prosecutors. Along the way to writing and releasing her Big Books, she gathers chaff which never quite made it into a book of its own - hence these \"Ann Rule Crime Files\" paperbacks of which this is the 10th. There is one bigger/small novella length crime coverage and then the \"stocking stuffers.\" So, about once a year, Rule's readers get appetizers - not the \"Full Meal Deals\" that are Ann's forte. Still, a not-up-to-her-best Rule is better than the best of most of the rest in the genre. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",

Or does your colleague’s abrasive manner rub you the wrong way?\n\nYou are not alone. After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was ‘surrounded by idiots’, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people.\n\nSurrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with – in and out of the office – based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way we speak and share information.\n\nErikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication, advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or shut up. Packed with ‘aha!’ and ‘oh no!’ moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand and communicate with those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension.\n\nAnd with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn’t you!",

        "comment": "To be completely honest, I decided to read this book, titled Surrounded by Idiots - The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and Life), after a particularly difficult day of teaching high school students. I saw the words “Surrounded by Idiots” in the list of options and thought, yup that’s the one. Every teacher can relate to those difficult days sometimes, but the ideas Erikson writes about in this book can be relatable to anyone at any time. He starts off explaining that we, in fact, are not surrounded by idiots. We are simply surrounded by people who are different than us and who think differently than us. Everyone has a tendency to think people who are different than us are idiots, but that is not necessarily the case.\nPerhaps if I was having a better day when I chose to read this book, I would have looked at the rest of the title – “The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and Life).” This is a little more descriptive of the ideas Erikson touches on. The four types of human behavior, as Erikson explains it, is broken down into four different colors. This is just his way of organizing the information, but I find it clever and easy to follow. Erikson says on page 13, that most of the population is a combination of two colors, while few are purely one color or a mixture of three colors. He starts off with just describing personality characteristics of each color and how to recognize if someone in your life is a red, yellow, green, or blue. I very much enjoyed this, because I could pin point exact people in my life and what color they are. My sister is a dead on Red for instance. Throughout all the chapters of Surrounded by Idiots, I could confirm my sister is a Red in the way she handles conflict, in her body language, in how she sends emails (my sister and I are also coworkers), and in what “makes her mad as hell” as Erikson puts it.\nI am a self-proclaimed Green. My Red sister and I get along great in social situations, but when it comes to making plans… that is a different story. Erikson talks about how the different colors work together and what challenges they may face starting on page 193. This got me thinking more about work related relationships, and I’ve got to say, Erikson is completely right in his assessment of collaborating colors. I won’t spoil all the details for you, but again it brought up situations I’ve been in with coworkers, etc. You may be able to tell from what I’ve written so far, but it was extremely difficult for me to not think of every single person in my life (work or social) and how they match up with the different colors in this book and the relationship I have with people of each personality type. This was enjoyable to me.\nErikson touches on many character traits, in work and social situations, of all four colors and how they communicate with the other colors – hence the more descriptive part of the title. He also gives plenty real life examples of coworkers of his or friends of his and their interactions. This made it realistic or relatable to me. I will say, it is kind of hard not to get defensive or think “nu uh, you’re wrong Erikson!” when he describes the weakness of the color(s) you identify with most. But keep in mind, and Erikson will remind also remind you, we are all human and no one or one personality color is perfect or superior. Overall, I very much enjoyed reading Surrounded by Idiots even though it was not the book I thought it was when I hit “buy with one click” on Amazon. As a teacher, I would highly recommend this book to other teachers because you will think of certain students or coworkers who are Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue as you read and get insight on how to work with them in a productive and empathetic manner. I’d give the book a 4.5/5. (I’d give it a 5, but it touched on some of my Green insecurities). The book is $14.99 here on Amazon and is 270 pages in length.",

        "comment": "This book describes four behavior types by sorting them into colors: red, blue, green and yellow. People that are sorted into these behavior types typically exhibit the same characteristics. For example, the book claims that green individuals are typically laid back and sometimes struggle to make decisions. Since teachers need to be able to understand and manage behavior, this book can be a foundation for how we interpret different social situations with students. While Erikson does point out that we should not use this classification method on children, it does give us some background knowledge on students and what drives behavior (e.g. environment).\nThere are many aspects of the book that I enjoyed. The book begins with a description of how and why he and his father began classifying behavior in this way. They used what is called the DISC method to establish these four behavior types. He explains that most people are a combination of two or three behavior types; very few people are just one type. Erikson describes the basis of behavior – what causes us to behave in the way that we do. He then moves on to provide an overview of the system, listing characteristics of each color in a diagram provided on page thirteen. After this introduction, he dives into how we can recognize each behavior type, how each behavior type deals with stress, which behavior types are best suited to work together, how to give feedback to each behavior type and so on. In chapter nineteen, Erikson provides examples of how people who have been sorted into the different behavior types react to different questions about their behavior and the book. Each of these people who were interviewed have read the book and are able to explain how they feel about the portrayal of individuals who belong to the group they do – most of them seem almost annoyed. For example, Hakan seems annoyed that the interviewer points out what he says is contradictory. The book ends with an interactive quiz, which is perhaps one of my favorite parts. It allows the reader to self-assess and determine what they took from this book and how they (now) understand the different behavior types.\nWhile there are not many things that I would change about the book, there are some pieces that could help provide some clarity for the reader. I loved how each behavior was talked about in detail; however, there were some parts where I really had to stop and think about what behavior was being talked about and reflect on what was said about that “color” chapters beforehand. This was likely due to the fact that it would spend the course of four chapters talking about each behavior type individually in relation to one concept or situation. It may have been better for the author to adjust this so that each situation was talked about for a single behavior type. For example, perhaps chapters four through nine could have talked about just green behavior, describing the different situations, scenarios and ideas that are discussed for that behavior throughout the book. This was not a huge issue since there were a variety of visuals, but it may be difficult for some readers who lack reading comprehension skills or have problems organizing information in their minds.",

It has plenty of examples, and suggestions for how to approach people more successfully based on their traits. My only hesitation is that it’s too easy to make assumptions and stereotype based on only this aspect of personality. “Oh, he’s just a yellow.” Is that true, or is there something specific to how he’s behaving that’s more important? There are a lot of areas where we can categorize people — generation, education level, social status… where all the people in that group behave in a similar way. This is a very valid one, but I would have liked to see at least a nod to some of the other ones as well. When we did this exercise at work, I noticed that there were people I thought were great in all four categories, and people I thought were… less great in all four.",

The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.\n\nEngaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.",

        "comment": "When you come late to the party, writing the 160th review, you have a certain freedom to write something as much for your own use as for other readers, confident that the review will be at the bottom of the pile.\n\nKahneman's thesis is that the human animal is systematically illogical. Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.\n\nThe first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow, applying human logic, we might reflect that it is probably Johnny coming back from the Girl Scout camp across the river bringing cookies, and that running might not be the best idea. However, fast thinking is hardwired.\n\nThe first part of the book is dedicated to a description of the two systems, the fast and slow system. Kahneman introduces them in his first chapter as system one and system two.\n\nChapter 2 talks about the human energy budget. Thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain. Moreover, despite what your teenager tells you, dedicating energy to thinking about one thing means that energy is not available for other things. Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.\n\nChapter 3 expands on this notion of the lazy controller. We don't invoke our slow thinking, system two machinery unless it is needed. It is expensive. As an example, try multiplying two two-digit numbers in your head while you are running. You will inevitably slow down. NB: Kahneman uses the example of multiplying two digit numbers in your head quite frequently. Most readers don't know how to do this. Check out \"The Secrets of Mental Math\" for techniques. Kahneman and myself being slightly older guys, we probably like to do it just to prove we still can. Whistling past the graveyard - we know full well that mental processes slow down after 65.\n\nChapter 4 - the associative machine - discusses the way the brain is wired to automatically associate words with one another and concepts with one another, and a new experience with a recent experience. Think of it as the bananas vomit chapter. Will you think of next time you see a banana?\n\nChapter 5 - cognitive ease. We are lazy. We don't solve the right problem, we solve the easy problem.\n\nChapter 6 - norms, surprises, and causes. A recurrent theme in the book is that although our brains do contain a statistical algorithm, it is not very accurate. It does not understand the normal distribution. We are inclined to expect more regularity than actually exists in the world, and we have poor intuition about the tail ends of the bell curve. We have little intuition at all about non-Gaussian distributions.\n\nChapter 7 - a machine for jumping to conclusions. He introduces a recurrent example. A ball and bat together cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? System one, fast thinking, leaps out with an answer which is wrong. It requires slow thinking to come up with the right answer - and the instinct to distrust your intuition.\n\nChapter 8 - how judgments happen. Drawing parallels across domains. If Tom was as smart as he is tall, how smart would he be?\n\nChapter 9 - answering an easier question. Some questions have no easy answer. \"How do you feel about yourself these days?\" Is harder to answer than \"did you have a date last week?\" If the date question is asked first, it primes an answer for the harder question.\n\nSection 2 - heuristics and biases\n\nChapter 10 - the law of small numbers. In the realm of statistics there is a law of large numbers. The larger the sample size, the more accurate the statistical inference from measuring them. Conversely, a small sample size can be quite biased. I was in a study abroad program with 10 women, three of them over six feet. Could I generalize about the women in the University of Maryland student body? Conversely, I was the only male among 11 students and the only one over 60. Could they generalize anything from that? In both cases, not much.\n\nChapter 11 - anchors. A irrelevant notion is a hard thing to get rid of. For instance, the asking price of the house should have nothing to do with its value, but it does greatly influence bids.\n\nChapter 12 - the science of availability. If examples come easily to mind, we are more inclined to believe the statistic. If I know somebody who got mugged last year, and you don't, my assessment of the rate of street crime will probably be too high, and yours perhaps too low. Newspaper headlines distort all of our thinking about the probabilities of things like in and terrorist attacks. Because we read about it, it is available.\n\nChapter 13 - availability, emotion and risk. Continuation.\n\nChapter 14 - Tom W's specialty. This is about the tendency for stereotypes to override statistics. If half the students in the University area education majors, and only a 10th of a percent study mortuary science, the odds are overwhelming that any individual student is an education major. Nonetheless, if you ask about Tom W, a sallow gloomy type of guy, people will ignore the statistics and guess he is in mortuary science.\n\nChapter 15 - less is more. Linda is described as a very intelligent and assertive woman. What are the odds she is a business major? The odds that she is a feminist business major? Despite the mathematical impossibility, most people will think that the odds of the latter are greater than the former.\n\nChapter 16 - causes trump statistics. The most important aspect of this chapter is Bayesian analysis, which is so much second nature to Kahneman that he doesn't even describe it. The example he gives is a useful illustration.\n* 85% of the cabs in the city are green, and 15% are blue.\n* A witness identified the cab involved in a hit and run as blue.\n* The court tested the witness' reliability, and the witness was able to correctly identify the correct color 80% of the time, and failed 20% of the time.\nFirst, to go to the point. Given these numbers, most people will assume that the cab in the accident was blue because of the witness testimony. However, if we change the statement of the problem so that there is a 20% chance that the blue identification of the color was wrong, but 85% of the cabs involved in accidents are green, people will overwhelmingly say that the cab in the accident was a green madman. The problems are mathematically identical but the opinion is different.\nNow the surprise. The correct answer is that there is a 41% chance that the cab involved in the accident was blue. Here's how we figure it out from Bayes theorem.\nIf the cab was blue, a 15% chance, and correctly identified, an 80% chance, the combined probability is .15 * .8 = .12, a 12% chance\nIf the cab was green, an 85% chance, and incorrectly identified, a 20% chance, the combined probability is .85 * .2 = .17, a 17% chance\nSince the cab had to be either blue or green, the total probability of it being identified as blue, whether right or wrong, is .12 + .17 = .29. In other words, this witness could be expected to identify the cab as blue 29% of the time whether she was right or wrong.\nThe chances she was right are .12 out of .29, or 41%. Recommend that you cut and paste this, because Bayes theorem is cited fairly often, and is kind of hard to understand. It may be simple for Kahneman, but it is not for his average reader, I am sure.\n\nChapter 17 - regression to the mean. If I told you I got an SAT score of 750 you could assume that I was smart, or that I was lucky, or some combination. The average is only around 500. The chances are little bit of both, and if I take a test a second time I will get a lower score, not because I am any stupider but because your first observation of me wasn't exactly accurate. This is called regression to the mean. It is not about the things you are measuring, it is about the nature of measurement instruments. Don't mistake luck for talent.\n\nChapter 18 - taming intuitive predictions. The probability of the occurrence of an event which depends on a number of prior events is the cumulative probability of all those prior events. The probability of a smart grade school kid becoming a Rhodes scholar is a cumulative probability of passing a whole series of hurdles: studying hard, excelling in high school, avoiding drink and drugs, parental support and so on. The message in this chapter is that we tend to overestimate our ability to project the future.\n\nPart three - overconfidence\n\nChapter 19 - the illusion of understanding. Kahneman introduces another potent concept, \"what you see is all there is,\" thereinafter WYSIATI. We make judgments on the basis of the knowledge we have, and we are overconfident about the predictive value of that observation. To repeat their example, we see the tremendous success of Google. We discount the many perils which could have totally derailed the company along the way, including the venture capitalist who could have bought it all for one million dollars but thought the price was too steep.\n\nChapter 20 - The illusion of validity. Kahneman once again anticipates a bit more statistical knowledge than his readers are likely to have. The validity of a measure is the degree to which an instrument measures what it purports to measure. You could ask a question such as whether the SAT is a valid measure of intelligence. The answer is, not really, because performance on the SAT depends quite a bit on prior education and previous exposure to standardized tests. You could ask whether the SAT is a valid predictor of performance in college. The answer there is that it is not very good, but nonetheless it is the best available predictor. It is valid enough because there is nothing better. To get back to the point, we are inclined to assume measurements are more valid than they are, in other words, to overestimate our ability to predict based on measurements.\n\nChapter 21 - intuitions versus formulas. The key anecdote here is about a formula for predicting the quality of a French wine vintage. The rule of thumb formula beat the best French wine experts. Likewise, mathematical algorithms for predicting college success are as least as successful, and much cheaper, than long interviews with placement specialists.\n\nChapter 22 - expert intuition, when can we trust it? The short answer to this is, in situations in which prior experience is quite germane to new situations and there is some degree of predictability, and also an environment which provides feedback so that the experts can validate their predictions. He would trust the expert intuition of a firefighter; there is some similarity among fires, and the firemen learns quickly about his mistakes. He would not trust the intuition of a psychiatrist, whose mistakes may not show up for years.\n\nChapter 23 - the outside view. The key notion here is that people within an institution, project, or any endeavor tend to let their inside knowledge blind them to things an outsider might see. We can be sure that most insiders in Enron foresaw nothing but success. An outsider, having seen more cases of off-balance-sheet accounting and the woes it can cause, would have had a different prediction.\n\nChapter 24 - the engine of capitalism. This is a tour of decision-making within the capitalist citadel. It should destroy the notion that there are CEOs who are vastly above average, and also the efficient markets theory. Nope. The guys in charge often don't understand, and more important, they are blind to their own lack of knowledge.\n\nPart four - choices\n\nThis is a series of chapters about how people make decisions involving money and risk. In most of the examples presented there is a financially optimal alternative. Many people will not find that alternative because of the way the problem is cast and because of the exogenous factors. Those factors include:\n\nMarginal utility. Another thousand dollars is much less important to a millionaire than a wage slave.\n\nChapter 26 - Prospect theory: The bias against loss. Losing $1000 causes pain out of proportion to the pleasure of winning $1000.\n\nChapter 27 - The endowment effect. I will not pay as much to acquire something as I would demand if I already owned it and were selling.\n\nChapter 28 - Bad Events. We will take unreasonable risk when all the alternatives are bad. Pouring good money after bad, the sunk cost effect, is an example.\n\nChapter 29 - The fourfold pattern. High risk, low risk, win, lose. Human nature is to make choices which are not mathematically optimal: buying lottery tickets and buying unnecessary insurance.\n\nChapter 30 - rare events. Our minds are not structured to assess the likelihood of rare events. We overestimate the visible ones, such as tsunamis and terrorist attacks, and ignore the ones of which we are unaware.\n\nChapter 31 - Risk policies. This is about systematizing our acceptance of risk and making policies. As a policy, should we buy insurance or not, recognizing that there are instances in which we may override the policy. As a policy, should we accept the supposedly lower risk of buying mutual funds, even given the management fees?\n\nChapter 32 - keeping score. This is about letting the past influence present decisions. The classic example is people who refuse to sell for a loss, whether shares of stock or a house.\n\nChapter 33 - reversals. We can let a little negative impact a large positive. One cockroach in a crate of strawberries.\n\nChapter 34 - Frames and reality. How we state it. 90% survival is more attractive than 10% mortality.\n\nPart V. Two selves: Experience and memory\n\nOur memory may be at odds with our experience at the time. Mountain climbing or marathon running are sheer torture at the time, but the memories are exquisite. We remember episodes such as childbirth by the extreme of pain, not the duration.\n\nLift decision: do we live life for the present experience, or the anticipated memories? Are we hedonists, or Japanese/German tourists photographing everything to better enjoy the memories?",

        "comment": "This is an invaluable book that every person who considers him/herself educated should read - even study. Indeed, it is a scandal that mastering the material in this book isn't considered an essential component of a high school education.\n\nThe author was awarded the Nobel in Economics for his work on what he calls decision theory, or the study of the actual workings of the typical human mind in the evaluation of choices, and the book itself presents the findings of many decades of psychological studies that expose the endemic fallacious thinking that we are all prone to, more or less. The lives of all of us could be improved by lessons learned from this book, not just individually, through self-education, but also on the large scale, if the large scale decision makers in this society in and out of government could be educated as well. In fact, it is largely because these large scale decision makers are no better than the rest of us in their ability to think straight and plan well, that society is as screwed up as it is, and that essentially all of its institutions are diseased and corrupt. The lesson there, however, is that decision making needs to be returned to the individual - that the powers that be need to be deprived of their powers to mess up the lives of the rest of us.\n\nDespite the many virtues of this book - it is well-written, engaging, and its academic author reasonably restrained in the tendencies of his tribe to blathering in abstractions - it is a bit disappointing at the very end, when the author proves unable to synthesize all his material into a comprehensive theory of the thinking, and deciding mind - or at least into a set of carefully formulated principles that provide a succinct summary of the principles of human thinking, both typical and ideal.\n\nKahneman uses throughout a construct that implies that we are of two minds: System 1 is the fast-thinking, intuitive, mind, prone to jumping to conclusions; while System 2 is the slow-thinking analytical mind, that is brought into play, if at all, only to critique and validate the conclusions that we have jumped to. System 2, we are told, is lazy, and if often just rubber-stamps the snap judgements of System 1, or if pressed, rationalize them, instead of digging critically as well as constructively into the complex underpinnings of the material and sorting them out as best it can.\n\nInstead of working this construct up into a comprehensive model of mind, K merely uses it as a loose schema for representing the kinds of thinking thought to underlie the results derived from the many psychological experiments that he here reports on. This neglect raises the question at many points as to just how well the experimenters have really understood the thinking that underlies the behavior of their subjects. But this, I am sorry to say, is a weakness of virtually all psychological experimentation, which is still just beginning to come to grips with the complexity and varieties of cognitive style of the human mind.\n\nWhat Kahneman does do, however, is to provide convenient labels for many characteristic types of fallacious thinking, although again, the exact role of System 1 and System 2, and their interaction, is inadequately explicated. Instead, towards the end of the book, another, somehow related, but nominally independent theme is developed: the disturbing divergence between the experiencing self and the remembering self. This is in itself such an interesting and important idea, so pregnant with both psychological and philosophical implications, that it could have used a fuller treatment, and again, there is no coherent integration of this theme with the System1/System2 construct.\n\nThe idea here is that our present experience includes our most salient memories of previous experiences - for example the highlights of past vacations, or out of the ordinary episodes of our lives. Somewhat surprisingly, though, what we remember is a systematic distortion of the actual experience. Our memory collapse the duration of various aspects of our experience and highlights only the peak moment(s) and the final moments, perhaps with a nod toward the initial presentation of the experience. And this systematic distortion of the actual experience in all its fullness, can lead us to make irrational and detrimental choices in deciding whether to repeat the experience in the future. Thus, a bad ending to an otherwise wonderful experience can spoil the whole thing for us in memory, and cause us to avoid similar experiences in the future, even though by simply anticipating and improving the ending we might make the whole experience as wonderful as most of the original was. Likewise, subjects in experiments involving either long durations of pain, or much shorter episodes of pain with a higher peak, were consistently more averse to the latter rather than the former - or they overemphasized the way these presentations ended as a factor in judging them as a whole.\n\nThese are important findings that go the heart of the question of how best to steer our course through life, but here is the only attempt at integration of this remembering vs experiencing self theme, and the System 1/ System 2 theme that I find in the final chapter, Conclusions:\n\n\"The remembering self is a construction of System 2. However, the distinctive features of the way it evaluates episodes and lives are characteristics of our memory. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule originate in System 1 and do not necessarily conform to the values of System 2\".\n\nThere is more here, but it merely repeats the earlier analysis of the relevant experiments.\n\nNo evidence is presented as to the respective roles of System 1 and System 2 with respect to the laying down of memory, to its decay, or with respect to a recently discovered phenomenon: memory reconsolidation. Nor is any account taken of what has been learned, much of it in recent decades, about the interactions between short, intermediate, and long term memory, or any of the radically different modalities of episodic (picture strip) and semantic (organized, abstracted) memory. Consequently, Kahneman's vague reference to the \"characteristics of our memory\" is essentially a ducking of the question of what the remembering self is. I think that at best, the finding of the replacement of the original experience by an abstract predicated on peak-end bias is an exaggeration, though there's no question that \"duration neglect\" is in operation, and a good thing too, unless K means by \"duration neglect\" not just the stretches of minimally changing experience (which have little memorial significance anyway, but even the consciousness of how long the edited out parts were (this distinction was never made in Chapter 35, where the theme of the remembering vs. the experiencing self is first taken up).\n\nSpeaking for myself anyway, I have a much fuller memory of my most important experiences than Kahneman seems to indicate. Naturally the highlights are featured, but what I tend to remember are representative moments that I took conscious note of at the time, as though making a psychological photograph. I remember these moments also because I bring them up from time to time when I'm thinking about that experience. For example, I'm thinking now of a long distance race I did in 2014 (a very tough half-marathon, with almost 2000' of climbing). I remember: the beginning section as well as the ending section; each of the rest stations; certain moments of each of the major hill climbs; at least one moment from each of the descents; and a number of other happenings during the almost three hour event. For me in this race, the peak experience occurred right at the end, when I all but collapsed, yet managed to stagger to the finish line. That ending does naturally come first to mind as a representation of the entire event, but it is merely the culmination of a long and memorable experience with many moving parts, and if I want, my remembering self can still conjure up many other moments, as well as a clear sense of the duration of each of the sections of the course.\n\nOver many years most memories fade, and it's certainly reasonable to suppose that in extreme cases, where they are all but forgotten, only a single representative moment might be retained. However, if we can say anything for sure about memory it is this: we remember what we continue to think of and to use, and we do that precisely because this material has continuing importance to us. The recent research in memory reconsolidation tells us that when we do bring up memories only occasionally, we reinforce them, but we also edit and modify them to reflect our current perspectives, and sometimes we conflate them with other seemingly related knowledge that we've accrued. We are thus prone to distort our own original memories over time, in some cases significantly, but we may still retain much more of the original experience that just the peak and the end, and if we do reinterpret our memories in the light of more recent experience, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In any case, the memories that occur in the present may be said to be a joint project of the experiencing as well as the remembering self, which rather erodes the whole Two Selves concept that Kahneman first posited.\n\nI do not mean to criticize the valuable evidential material in the book, and in general I think that Kahneman, and the other researchers and thinkers whom he quotes, have drawn reasonable conclusions from the experiments they report on. But ultimately, the book, as well as the fields both of psychology and brain neurophysiology suffer both in coherence and meaningfulness because they aren't predicated on a more comprehensive theory of mind. It's the old story in science, first formulated by Karl Popper in his 1935 book, The Logic of Scientific Discovery: unless we approach the data with an hypothesis in mind - unless, indeed, we seek out data likely to be relevant to a particular hypothesis, we're not going to make any enduring progress in understanding that data in a comprehensively meaningful way, let alone be able to make falsifiable deductions about elements of the system for which we have at present no data. Popper's quotation from the German philosopher Novalis comes to mind - \"Theories are nets: only he who casts will catch.\"\n\nIn the final, \"Conclusions\", chapter, K caricatures the abstract economists' model of homo econimicus (man as a rational optimizer of his utility), contrasting it with the more sophisticated and experientially grounded model of psychologists such as himself. In keeping with his penchant for framing (or spinning) his presentation favorably to his own perspective, he calls the economists' model \"Econ\", and his own \"Human\". In fact, \"Econ\" was never meant to represent man in all his humanity, and Kahneman's Economics Nobel, recognizing his decision theory contributions to economics, was preceded by many other Nobels to economists who had been expanding the concept of the economic actor into psychological territory for decades. In fact, the essential view of the Austrian economists dating from the 1920s (von Mises, Hayek, and their predecessors) is that economics is in the end wholly dependent on psychology because it is predicated on the unknowable, unquantifiable subjective value preferences of humans, acting individually and in concert. Cautious generalizations can perhaps be made about human psychology in general, but I think that on the whole the Austrians have been a bit wiser in their restraint than Kahneman and his many, and mostly lesser, pop psychology compatriots have proved in their often sensationalist extrapolations from lab experiments.\n\nHere is an example, I think of Kahneman over-reaching. He speaks repeatedly of the laziness of System 2, and its foot dragging reluctance to get involved in the thinking process, but in the real world, snap judgements are good enough for immediate purposes, and the better part of rationality may be to go with one's fast thinking intuitive System 1: indeed, Kahneman acknowledges this himself in passing, both in his beginning and his ending, but this isn't enough to counterbalance the overall argument of his book.\n\nKahneman also, in his final chapter, speculatively extends his findings into the political sphere (his liberal Democratic Party bias has already been made clear by gratuitous and somewhat annoying usage of salient modern politicians in examples), but not to any great effect.\n\nKahneman advocates \"libertarian paternalism\" consisting of government programs that people are enrolled in automatically unless they opt out by checking a box on forms - thus manipulating the presentation frame so as to trick them into signing on to what some government bureaucrat thinks is good for them. Of course, as long as people are allowed to opt out, one can't call the choice here anything but libertarian, though to be consistent with their socialist mores, liberals like Kahneman really ought to object to such practices as being manipulative advertising. This libertarian finds nothing objectionable about the way such a choice might be presented - after all, the average man, if adequately educated and prepared for the real world, should have no trouble seeing through the frames. What is not only paternalistic, but totalitarian in spirit, is the extortion of taxpayer money to finance such government programs in the first place.\n\nSomehow, it fails to occur to Kahneman that most people could be trained to recognize and avoid fallacious thinking during all those years of enforced and mostly wasteful schooling - just as most people can be trained to recognize the Müller-Lyer illusion for what it is. IMO every high school graduate should be required to learn to recognize and avoid the paradigm cases of fallacious thinking presented in Thinking, Fast, and Slow, and this material could profitably be expanded to cover the many rhetorical tricks used by the manipulators and spinmeisters, both public and private, who batten off of our society. With such training in critical thinking, and with the reintroduction of enough honest and rigor to begin high school graduates up to the 12th grade reading and writing proficiencies that were routine in the 1950s, the need for college as life preparation would be altogether obviated, and most young people could avoid wasting their early years in college, piling up debt, and get on with their work and/or their self-education, as they chose.",

    "synopsis": "Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this multi-million-copy New York Times bestseller is the definitive manual for anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control – from the author of The Laws of Human Nature.\n\nIn the book that People magazine proclaimed “beguiling” and “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.\n \nSome laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package, The 48 Laws of Power is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.",

        "comment": "there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact you\n\nFirst, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas\n1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can \"not participate\" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still. Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples\n2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS. If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this book.\n\nThings I Liked\n- NEW PARADIGM\nafter reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.\n- INCREASES POWER\none of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws\n-CRYSTAL CLEAR\nevery law is clearly outlined with \"transgression\" of the law, \"observance\" of the law, keys to power, and a \"reversal\"\n-GREAT STORIES\nthe 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\n-RISKY\nan old proverb says \" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten\". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships\n- REQUIRES DISCERNMENT\nif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says \"do xyz and you will accomplish vyx\" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply\n-NOT FOR EVERYONE\nIf you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.\n\nOVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.\nThanks for reading",

Everything in the book made so much sense… I shouldn't be fasting like my husband! Not enough studies are done on women, so this was a Very enlightening book! I related to some of the patients she referred to who had gone through conventional breast cancer treatment like I did last year. I stopped taking the medication. They prescribed due to awful side effects and have been going the route of intermittent fasting and longer fast and cleaning up my diet and feel 1 million times better! I am post menopausal and felt it's so important for my 44-year-old daughter to have this wonderful information that Dr. Mindy shares… Bought her a copy as well (kept my copy for reference)!

Military/SEAL fitness programs and many others) training has always been part of my regular working out routines. One of the many things that come with normal aging is the range of motion decreases even when you keep yourself in good physical condition. When I saw this interesting and informative 136 page soft cover book (Stretching for 50+ A customized program for increasing flexibility, avoiding injury and enjoying an active lifestyle by Dr. Karl Knopf) I decided to purchase it.\n\nIt was delivered in a short time and even though I have many years of experience in doing numerous stretching and flexibility exercises; nevertheless, I learned a lot from reading this book and working on many of the stretching movements. This book is aimed at those of us over 50 years old and I am way beyond that young age (oh to be 50 again!) at this time.\n\nThis excellent manual is organized into three parts. Part one covers flexibility and aging, tune in to your body, how to stretch and flexibility self-evaluations. Part two focuses on specialized program, general flexibility, novice, wake-up routine, chronic conditions, recreational pursuits and daily activities. The final part of this book shows the numerous types of stretching movements to do for your neck, shoulders, chest area, forearm, wrist, hands, lower back region, upper legs, lower legs, feet and ankles.\n\nIf are a senior fitness enthusiast and need help in learning and doing stretching and flexibility exercises this book is for you.\n\nRating: 5 Stars.

        "comment": "I realize I'm in the minority with a 3 star review. Much of the information is sound, but I have to take issue with the categories of stretches, which provides a foundation for all the programs in the book. In the How to Stretch section and What Are the Basic Types of Stretches? paragraph, the author states there are two types of stretches: 1) Ballistic (or bouncing), and 2) Static.\n\nMost authors agree with the author on the problems with ballistic stretches, but this author ignores the dynamic (non-ballistic) stretches. It's understandable if the author does not want to include variations, such as PNF stretches, to avoid over-complicating a basic book. There are other books, also for beginners or seniors, that do address these stretches. But ignoring the entire category of dynamic stretches is a major shortfall and short-changes readers of the advantages of a program with both dynamic and static stretches.\n\nThe other books I'm comparing this to were copyright 2016 and 2019. This book is copyright 2004 and 2017. I noticed the artwork and photographs were copyright 2017, so perhaps the other material is from 2004. That might explain this deficiency.",

    "synopsis": "If you grew up with an emotionally immature, unavailable, or selfish parent, you may have lingering feelings of anger, loneliness, betrayal, or abandonment. You may recall your childhood as a time when your emotional needs were not met, when your feelings were dismissed, or when you took on adult levels of responsibility in an effort to compensate for your parent’s behavior. These wounds can be healed, and you can move forward in your life.\n\nIn this breakthrough book, clinical psychologist Lindsay Gibson exposes the destructive nature of parents who are emotionally immature or unavailable. You will see how these parents create a sense of neglect, and discover ways to heal from the pain and confusion caused by your childhood. By freeing yourself from your parents’ emotional immaturity, you can recover your true nature, control how you react to them, and avoid disappointment. Finally, you’ll learn how to create positive, new relationships so you can build a better life.\n\nDiscover the four types of difficult parents:\n\nThe emotional parent instills feelings of instability and anxiety\nThe driven parent stays busy trying to perfect everything and everyone\nThe passive parent avoids dealing with anything upsetting\nThe rejecting parent is withdrawn, dismissive, and derogatory",

Until we start learning the lessons children bring to us, this world will never be healed. I searched endlessly and contacted various organizations and publishing companies, and YouTube podcasters looking for a book or any material that could help me heal from the subtle yet profound scars of covert child abuse, and even Hay House had nothing. Then I read an article on Psychology today, which mentioned this book. I listened to it twice on audible and proceeded to buy it anyway. Dr. Gibson doesn't necessarily use the words covert child abuse, but as an adult child of 56, I am equipped to say, that this book covers it pretty well. In addition you feel like you had a session with this woman doctor and you feel like the recipient of much needed quality therapy, the kind a lot of us can't afford to pay for. From the first page, you are in session with Dr. Gibson, and I needed a therapist urgently. She delivered with plenty on examples to identify with, offered actionable steps to use when in crisis and didn't fill it up with pages of jargon, who only go to satisfy a publisher's page quota number. Every page counts. What I would give to have her as a therapist. Unfortunately she practices in Virginia and I am in New Mexico, and her practice only accepts certain insurances. I doubt it she has a sliding scale or does pro bono.\nBut I'm not complaining ....this will sustain me until I find a clinical psychologist of equal depth , experience and value, my budget can afford to pay. Thank you!",

This wasn't a book I could finish in one day. It is a fairly small book however it took me months to finish. Each time I read the book I was reflecting on the relationships I observed as a child. I had a lot of reflecting and processing to do while reading this book. HOWEVER, I found a lot of comfort after finishing the book. The book gives adequate and for someone who has been utilizing some of the skills for a while. I can say the tactics, enlightenment, and reframing the book gives on the mind is reliving.

Put in a much nicer way but still was too similar of what I’ve been told all my life “get over it”.

In that, the author expounds briefly on information you want to take in, but invariably supplies three pages of a personal story then moves on to a new section without any summarizing or further detail on that subject. This occurs quite frequently throughout the book, so much so that I feel the personal accounts are roughly a third to half of this modest sized book.\n\nBy midway through I began skipping all these frivolous, supporting stories and that's when I actually began to enjoy the book much better. Silencing all the distracting voices which the author perpetually supplied helped me connect to the source material and reflect on my own memories/stories. Which, I assume, was the point of the book overall.",

It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.”—Oprah Winfrey\n\nThis book is going to change the way you see your life.\n\nHave you ever wondered \"Why did I do that?\" or \"Why can't I just control my behavior?\" Others may judge our reactions and think, \"What's wrong with that person?\" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard. It's time we started asking a different question.\n\nThrough deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from asking “What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?”\n\nHere, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a young age. In conversation throughout the book, she and Dr. Perry focus on understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. It’s a subtle but profound shift in our approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear a path to our future—opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way.",

        "comment": "I came across this book by chance at the start of my healing journey. Now I am aware and have answers to many questions I had over the years. I have a better understanding of how much what happened to me as a child affected me over the years. Unconsciously, it has played a role in my decision making over these many years. I spent many years not remembering and not being able to talk about anything painful.\n\nGrowing up in a house where kids should be seen and not heard. He would rather me be dead. While the one parent has, and continues, to be compliant and obedient to her husband for the most part. That's what I learned and grew up doing as well. Putting up with the abuse until I get so depressed I would rather be dead. My breaking point, with so much anger towards myself is when I make myself gain the strength to leave.\n\nBeing the youngest child, I have been abused verbally and physically by the siblings over these years. Even as an adult. I was molested by one as a child. I was labeled as the \"bad kid\" at an early age in school. Not knowing at the time I was unconsciously trying to bring attention to myself and what was going on at the time. No one cared. Zero cares when I got a poem published in the school newspaper about me being dead.\n\nI grew up during a time that you either have resilience to make something of yourself or stay the weekest link. A time when no one cared. Mental health was a taboo or bs. A time that self harm was for attention and not seen as a coping mechanism for painful trauma.\n\nNow I'm making what happened to me matter and addressing it. I've been unknowingly locked up in the painful trauma for years. Having to pretend to be fine being around the abusers. Even after remembering. It was hard to stand my ground at first. It's getting easier the more I learn so I can heal. Figuring out how to move on carrying this burden is the hardest part. I'm still working on the healing.",

        "comment": "The photo I shared is how my personal childhood trauma played out as an adult when I was 47. This book validates the experiences I had, and that in fact, I'm not an exception at all. My hope and prayer is that with this being on Oprah's list of 2021 best gifts that more folks will take the time to understand how in fact their past can and does play out in their life and in their relationships with others. The best gift any of us can give our children is to break generational cycles of abuse, neglect, and negative patterns. We can't do that without an understanding of how our brains work to deal with trauma we have experienced in our lives. Dr. Perry and Oprah take such a complicated topic and give concrete examples to help folks who haven't had exposure to this topic have a better understanding. You more than likely have had adverse experiences in your life that impact your current relationships. This book will help you have a better understanding of how past experiences play out in current relationships. Additionally, there are examples of how folks have overcome great adversities to go on and thrive. What happens to us doesn't have to define us or our future, we each need to process our past, understand how a wrong, injustice, or adversity, has shaped our worldview, and then make the decision to learn and grow from the experience. It's not easy, and I don't think in the book they allude to the fact that it is, it's very difficult, but as I've come to learn in life, probably like most folks, the rewards come after the difficult work/journeys. Nothing worthwhile in life is usually easy.\n\nMy personal experience, I was brought up in a middle class white family, graduated college at 23, and on to work full-time, a fulfilling career, until my childhood trauma was triggered when I felt bullied by a $3trillion company. I suffered from dissociative trauma, as a child, fight or flight were not options to the significant abuse I suffered. This bully triggered the bully from my childhood that significantly abused me and I took all the anger from my childhood bully and placed it on this company. Whether I was right or wrong in feeling bullied is moot, book will point to that. I resigned from a career at this company of 11 years, a good career, and went on to file multiple lawsuits consuming two years of my life, the picture shows I took the case all the way to The Supreme Court of the US, after I was rejected in every other court. You see the child who did not have a voice when she was being abused, was determined this time to be heard, hence all the lawsuits begging someone to see how I was being bullied. I wasn't successful, every court denied to allow me to go to discovery, which just again, reactivated my childhood trauma of not being heard. This started for me in 2014, it would take me 4 years to walk through the doors of a trauma counselor where I would connect all the dots and be flooded with past memories, experience PTSD, body sensations, and here I am 3 years later, healthier and whole, but it was the most difficult process I've ever experienced. I was lucky, I had an incredible support system in my husband and friends but I can easily see how this type of event would cripple anyone and how they could be ostracized by friends and family, not that I didn't experience some of that, but those who were there for me helped me overcome.\n\nSo, yes, I recommend the book because all of us have experienced adversities or trauma and most folks have no idea how it is playing out in their lives today and how they are passing it down to their children. If you take the time to be openminded, reflective, and honest, you will in fact take something away that will make your life better.\n\nThank you Dr. Perry and Oprah, for all the work you have done in this field for decades. I can't imagine how difficult it has to be to hear so many of these stories, live it, and know it, and see how slow our society has been to address mental health. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Oprah for putting it on your 2021 list, and thank you too for sharing your personal story, how you struggled and resolved your relationship with your mother, it moved me to tears, for many reasons. May God bless you each abundantly and may His hand be upon the mission of expanding this topic of What Happened To you?\n\nLeigh Ann Harris\nNorth Carolina",

My experience has been that self help books tend to be “preachy” when they contain biblical references. However, the authors dove deep into the meaning and origin of boundaries and apply more context with real life stories and teachings from the Bible. I have listened to the audio version five times now and decided to get a hard copy so I can reference when I want to. I have also shared this multiple times in a fb group - I believe it is that helpful. Highly recommend if you are someone who has trouble in any kind of relationship saying and keeping your No.",

Both practical and freeing.\n\nHowever, 2 complaints:\n1) Boundaries are very necessary for givers and helpers, but I didn't think the book did enough to address how selfish and off-putting people seem who have firm boundaries but don't seek to meet the needs of others. (It did mention being over-zealous as a stage.) You CAN pendulum to the other side of self-absorption. The being as comfortable saying \"yes\" as \"no\" was helpful.\n\n2) I thought the authors were irresponsible with Scripture at times, pulling verses out of context (\"pearl of great price\" to describe someone's soul, for example). Also, I'm pretty sure the 21st century western \"leave you parents at 18\" model wasn't prescribed by Jesus the way it sounded.\n\nI'd be interested in knowing how boundaries would work in healthy, interdependent (collectivistic rather than individualistic) cultures.",

But the man sitting next to me in 1B has different plans. Cash’s whiskey-colored eyes and easy smile beg me to dance beneath the stars, kiss in the moonlight, and walk hand in hand down the streets of Boston. Unfortunately, life has other plans because I’m in the middle of divorcing my cheating husband and finding Cash James a wife is the key to my dream promotion.\n\nMy job is simple—find Mr. James a wife. But nothing is easy when simply walking into his office and inhaling his woodsy scent makes me feel a buzz like I’ve just sipped straight from the whiskey bottle. He makes me tipsy with emotion. Breathless, fearless, and stupid.\n\nBecause no matter how good it feels in the moment, our love burns on the way down.\n\nWhiskey Lies is book one of the Falling for Whiskey duet. It is a Billionaire Romance and contains no cheating between the hero and heroine. This book is part of a duet and is not a standalone.",

        "comment": "Cash and Grace meet on a plane on their way to the Florida Keys for a weekend getaway, each for different reasons. She is an executive at a matchmaking firm for high profile rich people and he is about to take over as CEO of his family business, Whiskey and spirits. \nTheir attraction is instant and mutual, but she is having second thoughts for two reasons. The main one is that she is recently separated from her cheating husband and has not gotten a divorce yet and the second is that it is not in her nature to have one night stands.\nBut the attraction overrides all her inhibitions and they have a hot weekend affair. Their connection is incredible and you get both their POV and thoughts.\nDue to her work conditions she has to keep the pretense of a happy marriage for 1 more month since she is up for a promotion at her company and she cannot be known that she is getting a divorce due to her line of work. So she knows nothing can come of her weekend affair and on her last day she leaves without saying goodbye or sharing her contact information and she never gave Cash her last name. \nWhen she gets back to Boston  her boss and Godmother assigns her with a new and important client which is key for her promotion, none other than Cash James! Her weekend affair. \nThis is the point in which, for my personal opinion, I was annoyed by the FMC. Her inner thoughts and the lack of communication. For the depth of connection these characters shared during that weekend I cannot understand her decision not to share with him what she was going through and she lets him believe that her marriage is stable and that she is a cheater. Of course this makes the MMC so mad for personal and family reasons.\nThis goes back and forth, the miscommunication, the I want you but I don't,  the mutual jealousy, him discovering that she is getting a divorce until at the almost 50% mark they finally get together. With ups and downs this goes on until something happens and everyone in Cash’s family, including him, think it’s Grace’s doing… this book ends on a cliffhanger… on to book 2 Loving Whiskey. I enjoyed parts of this book and was annoyed at others. But I guess this is the author’s doing, to keep the reader riveted to the plot. I liked Cash as a character better than Grace. Spicy at times, I loved Cash’s dirty mouth 😅. Let's see how everything goes with book 2!\nListened to the audiobook. It was phenomenal! Narrated by Joe Arden and Lucy Rivers in duet, a great addition to the book!",

I didn’t even know it was a duet either so I CANNOT wait to dive into book 2 and get more of Cash and Grace! This book is a reverse age gap, forbidden and billionaire romance! It’s got the perfect meet cute in the beginning and transforms into such a captivating storyline that keeps you hooked until the very last page! If you are looking for a well written story with a fascinating plot that has drama, angst, hot spicy romance, high emotions and unexpected turns along the way then I highly suggest this book!\n\nThis book all begins on a plane. Grace is on her way to a weekend away after learning that her husband was having an affair. Meanwhile, her seat mate on that same plane is Cash, who getting away for a trip before he becomes CEO of his family’s company. They hit it off on the plane and spend the short vacation together, before Grace slips away at the end. Cash fell hard for her on that trip and wishes he knew who she was. Turns out he doesn’t have to look far, as Grace shows up to his work as he is her next client and she was hired to help find him a wife. *jaw drops* The plot just gets better from there and takes you on a rollercoaster that you don’t want to get off of! It will have you obsessed with the characters while taking you on a twisting ride and feeling all the emotions along the way! Buckle up and prepare for quite the trip! …and be sure to jump right into book 2, Loving Whiskey, after that cliffhanger ending!!!!\n\nWhen I saw this book was a duet narration, I had to have the audio and WOW, did it DELIVER!!! That was one of the best narrations I have ever listened to! Joe Arden and Lucy Rivers used their voices to perform the heck out of this book! I felt like I was watching a movie as I listened because it was that WELL DONE! They didn’t just read lines from a book, they PERFORMED them FLAWLESSLY! From Joe Arden’s perfect, sexy chuckle at times to his growl and then Lucy with her ability to encapsulate Grace’s personality in her voice. STUNNING audio! I will forever recommend this audio book as it was a masterpiece! It was truly performed in a way that transports you into this story as they brought so much emotion out in their voices!",

In this book I was a little underwhelmed with Grace’s lack of self-confidence, though it had merit considering her husband’s shenanigans.

    "synopsis": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Passionate advocate for end-of-life care and TikTok star Hadley Vlahos shares moving stories of joy, wisdom, and redemption from her patients’ final moments in this “brilliant” (Zibby Owens, Good Morning America) memoir.\n \n“This extraordinary book helps dispel fear around death and dying—revealing it to be a natural part of our soul’s evolution.”—Laura Lynne Jackson, New York Times bestselling author of Signs and The Light Between Us\n\nTalking about death and dying is considered taboo in polite company, and even in the medical field. Our ideas about dying are confusing at best: Will our memories flash before our eyes? Regrets consume our thoughts? Does a bright light appear at the end of a tunnel? For most people, it will be a slower process, one eased with preparedness, good humor, and a bit of faith. At the forefront of changing attitudes around palliative care is hospice nurse Hadley Vlahos, who shows that end-of-life care can teach us just as much about how to live as it does about how we die.\n \nVlahos was raised in a strict religious household, but began questioning her beliefs in high school after the sudden death of a friend. When she got pregnant at nineteen, she was shunned by her community and enrolled herself in nursing school to be able to support herself and her baby. But nursing soon became more than a job: when she focused on palliative care and hospice work, it became a calling. \n \nIn The In-Between, Vlahos recounts the most impactful experiences she’s had with the people she’s worked with—from the woman who never once questioned her faith until she was close to death, to the older man seeing visions of his late daughter, to the young patient who laments that she spent too much of her short life worrying about what others thought of her—while also sharing her own fascinating journey.\n \nWritten with profound insight, humility, and respect, The In-Between is a heartrending memoir that shows how caring for others can transform a life while also offering wisdom and comfort for those dealing with loss and providing inspiration for how to live now.",

        "comment": "July 28th 2023 marks a full year that my Great-Grandma had passed. Only she felt way more like a (second) mother. I had found Nurse Hadley- a Hospice nurse on TikTok prior to my Grandmas decline. It sparked my interest in learning more about Hospice but not enough. I hated thinking about Hospice and it was my least favorite thing to hear when a loved one was placed under their care. It made my heart cringe. Instant tears when Hospice was mentioned because it meant the time was ticking. My Grandma was placed under Hospice Palliative Care at the end of June. My biggest fear was coming true and I had to remain calm for my family, especially my Grandma. I wanted to spend every second with her that I could. I lived an hour away with my now husband and we shared one car and I was only bringing home $85 a week from a sandwich shop.. I would bring my then fiancé to work, sometimes a half hour from our apartment making the drive to Grandma an hour and a half long. I told my boss at the sub shop that I would need to stop working for the foreseeable future until everything was said and done. I knew I needed to soak in every. Little. Thing. So I drove an hour to an hour and a half every single day with the exception of one day. I would need to be back to pick up my fiancé by the end of his 8 hour shifts sometimes 10 and sometimes 12. No matter the amount of time that day, I spent it with Grandma. Things declined rapidly. I was feeding her ice cream sandwiches and giving her water one day. The next she couldn’t wake up or form coherent sentences. I ended up staying one evening at my Grandparents house in a camper in the yard. I told my fiancé I needed him to take the next day off. I couldn’t leave. We packed up and stayed in my parents RV at my Mimi & Papa’s house (where Grandma had been staying). We sat with her almost lifeless body and shared fond memories of our lives with her. We each took turns sitting in the chair next to her, holding her hand, kissing her head, and reminding her how loved she was. As the night went on she started this awful groaning and yelling. I was worried she was in pain and couldn’t stand to see her like that. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening or how we could help. My mom was once a hospice nurse and she told me it was okay. She was just having a family reunion with our passed on loved ones. I thought my mom had only told me this for comfort. My mom is a good mom and even at 23 often still protects my child-like heart. I accepted this as it gave me comfort to think like that but wasn’t totally sure I believed it. The next morning at 6:50 AM my Grandma passed away peacefully holding her sons hand. We got the phone call in the RV and all rushed in to say our goodbyes. My best friend was gone. In a way I felt like I was relieved because she wasn’t in pain anymore. She lived a long life (91 years) and passed away surrounded by some of the people who cared most about her. The hospice nurse came about an hour later and did the usual protocol. Listened to the heart for 2 minutes and called out the time of death. Later the kind nurse was comforting us and asked if I had any questions. I had mentioned the groaning the night before and asked if she was in pain. The nurse replied “oh no honey! She was definitely talking up a storm with your other loved ones who have passed on. Happens all the time!” I was shocked but again sort of assumed because I was young they were just trying to protect my feelings. They had previously left a booklet about the signs to look for when your loved one is dying. I took it and it sparked my interest. I read it and was always curios to know more. When I recently heard Nurse Hadley had a book about “The In-Between” I begged my husband to get it. I downloaded it to my Kindle and got to reading! I finished it July 27, 2023.. one night before the one year anniversary or my Grandmas passing. I found so much comfort and joy in reading nurse Hadley and her patients stories knowing my Grandma had a similar story to some of her patients. It made me feel so at peace that my grandma had such a peaceful passing. That she was seeing her parents, her siblings, her son Rickey. I know it was a reunion she waited many many years for. I felt at peace knowing that night she really wasn’t in pain. She was catching up with old friends in the in between and resting her soul in the real world for her big trip with them. “The In Between” was beautifully written by a wonderful nurse whom I’ve never met but reminded me a lot of my momma. A single mom of one child at a young age persuing a nursing career. This book has healed a little of my broken heart and I am grateful. ❤️",

        "comment": "In her remarkable book, Nurse Hadley takes readers on an emotional rollercoaster, sharing her experiences as a new nurse (and as a single mother dating Chris) to an experienced nurse alongside the poignant stories of her patients. With an engaging and personable writing style, she effortlessly draws readers into the world of life, death, and patients' profound impact on her life.\n\nEach chapter of this book introduces a new patient (including her boyfriend's mom) and their unique story, allowing us to witness firsthand how people live and the process of how they die. Through these stories, Hadley skillfully offers profound life lessons that transcend the boundaries of the medical field, leaving readers with a wealth of insight into the human psyche and our relationship with mortality.\n\nWhat sets this book apart is Hadley's ability to blend her narratives with the significance gleaned from her patients' journeys. This parallel storytelling approach lends depth to history and allows readers to connect with Hadley profoundly. Whether you find yourself laughing, shedding tears, feeling awe-struck, or pausing to re-read passages, you'll quickly realize that Nurse Hadley's words have a transformative power beyond the pages. Nurse Hadley teaches the reader through storytelling as her patients teach her their life lessons.\n\nAs a gifted writer, nurse, and YouTuber, Hadley captivates readers by challenging societal views on death. By sharing her experiences and the wisdom gained from her patients, she encourages readers to reflect on their beliefs and confront the inevitable reality of our mortality. Through storytelling, she gently guides us toward a greater understanding of death and helps us prepare for its profound impact on our lives and those we love.\n\nNurse Hadley's book is a must-read for everyone. Whether you have personally experienced loss or are simply curious about the human experience of dying, this book will touch your heart and leave an indelible mark on your soul. It serves as a compass, guiding us through the uncharted waters of death and revealing answers we may not have known we were searching for. She also shows that some people are not who they seem.\n\nUltimately, Nurse Hadley's words offer solace, enlightenment, and a renewed perspective on life's most profound questions. With its engaging storytelling and her wisdom from experience and skills, this book is a testament to the power of human connection and the importance of embracing life's final journey.\n\nI did not want this book to end.\nPlease write more, Nurse Hadley.\nPictures: 1: Hardcover front, 2 &3: Conclusion pages, and 4: Excellent tone in writing, 5: Rawness of Hadley's style.",

        "comment": "Many people shy away from the topics of terminal illness and death. This is definitely not true of Hadley Vlahos, R.N.!! Nurse Hadley has taken a topic that at one time was taboo and which is still, in 2023, often avoided. This book sheds light not only on final illness and death, it also touches on many other topics, as Nurse Hadley weaves her personal story throughout her Autobiography.\nThe reader is told of childhood trauma, unplanned pregnancy, single motherhood, changes in one’s life dreams, decision on a course of education and devoting oneself to study and learning, choice of a career of caring for others, finding true love in an unexpected way and place, empathy for patients and their family members, and the spirituality surrounding the end of life.\nThroughout this book is the overlay of LOVE. Love on many levels. Nurse Hadley has managed to inform the reader about aspects of the end of life in a way that is filled with love, light, release, joy and spirituality.\nI highly recommend this easily read book, which I will read again and again.

    "synopsis": "The first time I met the grumpy lumberjack next door, I almost burnt down his cabin.\n\nThe second time, I was throwing tampons at a moose (don’t ask).\n\nThe third time, I was naked.\n\nAnd Henri Gagnon is not just my neighbor and landlord, but a pain in my optimistic, plus sized ass. He’s got a protective streak under his grumpy exterior and he’s convinced I won’t make it through the Maine winter.\n\nI’m going to show him and the rest of this small town that they’re wrong. I have one year to prove myself as the new elementary school principal or I’ll be getting the ax. So I just don’t have time to pine away for the grumpy lumberjack next door, no matter how good he looks chopping wood in his suspenders or the way he growls when he calls me buttercup.\n\nBut soon I’m falling headfirst down a hill, and into a full blown crush when he carries me home. He’s distracted trying to save his family’s lumber business, and I’ve got a school to run, and this small town is not as sleepy as it seems. But despite our differences, the heat between us makes it hard to stay away.\n\nCould we actually be right for each other? What happens if I ask him if he Wood Be Mine?\n\nAuthor’s Note: Wood You Be Mine? is a standalone, full length, small town romance featuring a grumpy lumberjack hero with a heart of gold and a plus sized, sunshine school principal trying to survive in the woods of northern Maine. If you enjoy flirty banter, ax throwing, wood chopping, and slow dancing, come meet the Lovewell Lumberjacks.\n\nWelcome to Lovewell Maine, where the moose outnumber the people and you can't swing an ax without hitting a hot, grumpy lumberjack. Filled with humor, heart and heat, the Lovewell Lumberjack Series will melt Kindles in 2023.\n\nThe Lovewell Lumberjacks are ALL standalones, but are most fun when read in order!",

A woman with a good heart and a will to do better for her community, and the people who depended on her to be better than her predecessor. And grumpy lumberjack Henri. The reluctant landlord, the gruff protector, the eldest son with the weight of a town, his family, and an industry on his shoulders.\n\nAlice and Henri were great together. Their banter, their tension, their commitment to one another once the insecurity and fears were established and dealt with. And as always, I love that when conflict came, it didn’t cause division within their relationship. They banded together and continued to choose each other, no matter how much work or time or effort it would require.\n\nWood You Be Mine was a sweet, enjoyable start to a new series interwoven with a mystery that’ll be answered throughout.",

        "comment": "I received an ARC for Wood You Marry Me? but before I started that I wanted to be sure I read the first book in the series and thankfully I did! It’s obvious this series will be fully interconnected with an underlying mystery flowing throughout the series.\n\nHenri has lived in Lovewell, Maine his entire life and his family’s lumber mill, Gagnon Lumber, is one of four main mills in Maine. He is a grumpy lumberjack who lives in the woods enjoying his solitude until he gets a new tenant in his cabin next door. Alice Watson just moved to Lovewell to be the school’s new principal and is determined to make it a successful school again.\n\nThe two have a rocky start simply because Henri is stubborn and horrible with words, however once they cross that line nothing can stop them. I absolutely adored the Tucker/Goldie storyline and how much Alice and especially Henri doted on them. They were great as a family unit. My only complaint is that the story didn’t really have an ending. Henri and Alice were talking about a possible future and then the chapter/book just ends. I’m sure we will get more of them in the next book, but I wished I had some closure for them now.\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n🔥: Gagnon Island",

        "comment": "3.5/5 Stars\n\nLooking for a fresh start, Alice moves to rural Lovewell, Maine after she accepts a job as principal at a failing school. After years of putting everyone else’s needs above her own, she’s finally decided to focus on what she wants. Moving to a new town gives her a chance to shine. The last thing she has time for is her sexy landlord Henri. Too bad she can’t seem to stop embarrassing herself in front of him.\n\nWood You Be Mine? is book 1 in Daphne Elliot’s Lovewell Lumberjack Series. It’s an interconnected standalone, however it should be noted there is a secondary storyline that carries throughout the series and won’t be resolved in this book.\n\nGrumpy/Sunshine\nCurvy Heroine\nGrowly Lumberjack\nSmall Town\nNeighbors\nNew In Town\nFound Family\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.",

So she takes a job as principal in the close knit town of Lovewell. The school is not doing well and she has her work cut out for her. Alice is a really great FMC. I love her inner dialogues.\n\n“𝑴𝒂𝒚𝒃𝒆 𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒂 𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝒌𝒊𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒓? 𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒄𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒚, 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒅𝒊𝒅𝒏’𝒕 𝒃𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓 𝒎𝒆.

His father died suddenly (some mystery around it) and he inherited the struggling business. Henri is immediately drawn to Alice and she sets off his protective instincts. Alice finds herself some comical problems (a moose and weaponized tampons IYKYK) and her brawny lumberjack is there to help. Henri is a grump but also cares deeply for his loved ones.\n\n/“𝑱𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒔𝒂𝒚 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒕, 𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒖𝒑. 𝑰’𝒍𝒍 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕.”/\n\nI did find the pacing to be a little off. I really enjoyed to beginning and middle of the story. The push-pull between the MCs was great, the tension was steamy, and the spice was fire 🔥 I thought toward the end there was a lot going on and the book ended a little abruptly. It looks like this will be a series so hopefully we’ll get some answers about what happened to Henri’s dad.",
