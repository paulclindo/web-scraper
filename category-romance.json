    "synopsis": "From USA Today and Amazon Charts bestselling author Meghan Quinn, comes a new standalone age-gap rom-com featuring a new cast of characters that will immediately have you hooked. This steamy, laugh out loud, enemies-to-lovers small town romance delivers the perfect happily ever after every romance lover craves.\n\nWhy am I holding a box of stolen memorabilia in my arms? It's called . . . revenge.\n\nAfter failing my last semester of grad school, I decided to come back to my hometown and wallow in my boyfriend’s sympathetic arms. Instead, he proceeded to dump me . . . for being boring!\n\nNow, I'm not typically a spiteful person, but there's only so much I can take. Hence why I’m holding the box of his most cherished possessions…stolen possessions no less!\n\nThe plan? To give the box back to its rightful owner and rat my ex out. How’s that for being boring?\n\nBut plans never go the way you want them, because instead of dropping off the box with a note, I’m pinned with the crime by the true owner of the box himself.\n\nHayes Farrow is grumpy, arrogant, and stupidly hot in a way that makes it hard to even look him in the eye. Not to mention he’s my brother’s nemesis so I fully intended to stay far far away from the gorgeous jerk.\n\nBut to add insult to the injury that has become my life as of late, Hayes gives me two options: turn me into the police and press full charges . . . or work it off. How could I possibly work for someone I can't stand? Easy, I don't look good in orange.\n\nBut working for Hayes isn't as horrible as I thought it would be. The way I hate him begins to turn into something else - something I never thought I'd feel. But the way my brother reacts when he finds out I’m working for his enemy? He’d prefer me in prison orange.",

        "comment": "MQ is a one click author for me. I know I’m going to laugh hysterically many times through the book. And I did this time as well. There were plenty of laughs. I just wasn’t prepared for my heart to break as well. This book tore my heart right out of my chest, and I was definitely not expecting that.\n\nPoor Hattie lost her closest sister to cancer a few months ago, and she has been struggling. Cassidy was like a mother to her when they were left orphans, and they had worked hard together in the business Cassidy opened. She was away at school trying to finish her masters degree, and finds herself failing out of her final semester when she fails midterms. She returns to her hometown with her tail between her legs only to be dumped by her long term boyfriend for being “mopey and boring”. What a tool. Her siblings have completely pushed her away, she’s been unable to properly grieve, and now she’s terrified to tell her siblings she’s failed school because they are viciously insistent she finish. In a bit of revenge, while packing up her belongings from her boyfriend’s apartment, she grabs the box of memorabilia her ex had stolen from superstar Hayes. She was hoping to return them to Hayes, and also cause her ex to be fired from his job as Hayes’ assistant. Only Hayes blackmails her into being his new assistant. And then the fun begins. Especially as Hayes is the former best friend of her brother, and they have been mortal enemies for the past decade after a falling out. One more thing for Hattie to hide from her siblings.\n\nI have to be honest.. At 50% in, I didn’t want her to make up with her siblings. I understand they were all grieving on their own way, but they were cruel to her. She was the one closest to Cassidy, yet they pushed her away and basically cut her out of the family. She came back to town and her siblings went way for the weekend together and didn’t even invite her. I’m still sort of angry that she’s accepting their half a $$ apologies, as she was forced to be alone with her grief with no support, and they at least had each other. So yeah, I’m salty about it. She deserved better.\n\nUpdated to add- By the end of the story, I felt much better about her relationship with her siblings (although I’m not going to lie- still no love for Autumn). It sort of felt off that there was a total character reversal - that her brother ultimately supported her not finishing school and just wanted her to do what made her happy after so aggressively telling her to finish school asap, and then commented “I think we learned quickly after losing Cassidy that family is more important than anything.” It was almost like two different sets of characters as they definitely did not rally around Hattie at all after Cassidy’s death, but basically forgot about her and cut her out of the family. I get they all had childhood trauma and were struggling with their sister’s death but it still felt they were unnecessarily cruel to Hattie.\n\nHayes. Oh, Hayes. What a sweet, tortured, foolish man. Faced with a lifetime of abandonment issues, he could sure downward spiral like the rockstar he is. Hattie may have been a bit lost when she came to his house that day, but he had been lost for years. They managed to bring life back to each other. Their banter was hilarious. Their chemistry was electric. Their heartache was palpable.\n\nI cried. I laughed. (The nod to the pigeon rescue was hysterical! Thank you for that Easter egg!). I raged a bit at times. But I loved these two together, and while I hated the heartbreak they each endured, I’m so glad they came together as they are perfectly imperfect together.",

        "comment": "Let’s all agree right from the start that author Rebecca Yarros has an astonishing way with words. And emotions. And setting scenes. And situations. And making both the heartbreak and the incredible heat feel authentic. And the ability to accurately capture the political impacts and ramifications of the Afghanistan withdrawal on the servicemembers assigned the responsibility of carrying it out. And most amazing of all, the way she captures the military “feel” so perfectly and flawlessly. As a member of a military family myself and seeing from her author bio that she is too, I recognize the authenticity of her descriptions of the isolation, worry, separation, difficult deployments, forced lack of communication, trauma and fear of admitting any problems, pressure of everyone counting on you, having to be good at your job and knowing you are, but wary and reluctant about sharing details, or even sharing your emotions. Yarros tells it just like it is.\n\nIn the Likely Event is a perfect blend of over-the-top romance with real-life situations and decisions and the resulting consequences. Of desperately hoping someday will be the right time to “take your shot” but living with what is actually happening to you and around you in the meantime. It’s heated, poetic, romantic, intimate. The intense steamy scenes are realistic and believable, appropriately written and inserted in just the right places.\n\nChapters switch between Nathaniel and Isabeau, and also alternate between Afghanistan in 2021 when the dangerous, out of control presidential withdrawal is occurring, when Izzy finally sees that side of Nate he has always tried to hide and protect her from, and events beginning with the story of how they met in 2011 when he had just turned 19 and she was about to turn 18. Times when the magnet of fate has brought them together again, but never with the right timing to finally take their shot. Only twenty-seven days over ten years, but a connection that was and continues to be immediate, unexplainable – and undeniable.\n\nThe characters are so well drawn that they feel real. Like real people we want desperately to see happy and content. They feel so real because author Yarros so skillfully portrays their emotions. We see ourselves in little bits. We feel the pull, the uncertainty, the desire. Izzy is mesmerized by Nate the first time she sees him and every time after that: the smile, the dimple, the eyes, the body, the laser focus. And after she describes him a couple of times, we are mesmerized too. You will love Izzy, but Nate will become your new swoony hero: handsome (smoking hot actually and when that dimple pops . . . ), sensitive, brave, strong, gentle, caring. So in love it just overwhelms you even reading it. He will do anything – anything – if it means Izzy’s happiness, if it keeps her from one second of fear or unhappiness or worry. Even if it nearly destroys him. Perfect, isn’t he?\n\nIn the Likely Event was an Amazon First Reads choice for July 2023. It’s warm, sweet, funny, moving, romantic, steamy, with some serious trauma and topics and a pretty amazing twist. One of those books that grabs you, hugs you, and will never let go. One you could finish reading and then just flip right back to the beginning and start over. It’s that good. It’s all about timing and not waiting too long to take your shot, because timing is never really perfect, is it. When I was trying to decide which book to choose I read a sample of In the Likely Event, was immediately hooked, downloaded it, and finished it that same day. Yes, it’s that good. Yes, Rebecca Yarros’ writing is that good. I have now started with this fabulous author’s backlist and recommend you do the same. P.S. – check out the audiobook: amazing narrators and as perfect as print.",

        "comment": "My review is less about the synopsis since there are plenty of people that give that to you, and more about addressing some reviews that I think missed the mark...also it is about my opinion. Take it for what it's worth to you.\n\nThis is not the first book of Rebecca's that I have read, and in no way do I have any affiliation with her. Would I absolutely be her best friend? Yep! But sadly never met her. So this review is completely unbiased and I don't get anything from this. I'm not even an ARC reader so am under no obligation to say anything...but I like to review so here goes.\n\nFirst let's address some things that are being said in other reviews that are not fair...Is there a bit of cursing? Yes. Is it over the top? Not by a long shot, and it is used in appropriate settings and situations. In fact, for anyone that has spent any time around those in the military know she kept it incredibly tame. Is there a horrible war going on? Yes. As some reviewers have pointed out though, Rebecca doesn't go into detail about the ravaged land and how horrible it is for those living there but gives just pieces. She gives enough details to make the reader fully aware of the terrible things that happen, the fear, the uncertainty of those living there, and she pays respect to that. This book however is not about the war. It is not about the exit of government...So those low star reviews because a reader wanted the book to be a war book or a political stance? Go read a book about political uprisings and war. This book is openly marketed and very well marketed as a contemporary romance, so not sure why people go in and get a bent when it's a romance and they didn't know it so they trash the book. Sorry you picked up a romance and don't enjoy reading romances...how is that the book's fault? There are others as well that gave lower stars as they didn't like the character appearance description...I'm not gonna touch on that except to say, use your imagination if you wanna envision the characters differently. Stop giving low reviews because you want something different...review on the merits of the work.\n\nNow for my review....This is a masterfully written romance that takes you through several stages of the characters lives giving the reader the opportunity to experience them growing into the people they are now and how they grew together through the years while being apart. The thing I have learned about Rebecca's writing is that you can never go in thinking you know what twists and turns there will be...she is a pro at masking the end game and making it so much better than I hoped it would be. Her writing is captivating and when you get to the end and sit with it for a moment your brain starts to go back and rethink the parts you thought you knew what was happening. So btw...go back a read it a second time with ALL of the information and it gives an entirely new perspective and story entirely. I hardly ever read a book multiple times and yet it has become a habit with Rebecca's book...and I can tell you, it is like reading it for the first time again.\n\nThe banter between characters and emotion pulled me in from the first page and allowed me to feel all of it. I ached for the characters every step of the way and not only because of the romance, but what each character goes through in their lives. What they survive and live through shaped them in ways that once again made me feel as though each person she writes about is a real person and she is simply telling their story. There is so much cliche romance out there and we all love it for various reasons...this is not that. But she manages to put in the tropes we all love and look for, but does it with a freshness that is addicting.\n\nAnd let's just say....Ladyhawke...so much yes. So very much. Also...add the songs to your own playlists. You learn so much about people through their song lists and I was not disappointed at all when I paused reading to listen to what the characters were like through the music.",

    "synopsis": "* Instant NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY bestseller *\n* GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD WINNER for BEST DEBUT and BEST ROMANCE of 2019 *\n* BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR* for VOGUE, NPR, VANITY FAIR, and more! *\n\nWhat happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?\n\nWhen his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.\n\nHeads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.\n\n\"I took this with me wherever I went and stole every second I had to read! Absorbing, hilarious, tender, sexy—this book had everything I crave. I’m jealous of all the readers out there who still get to experience Red, White & Royal Blue for the first time!\" - Christina Lauren, New York Times bestselling author of The Unhoneymooners\n\n\"Red, White & Royal Blue is outrageously fun. It is romantic, sexy, witty, and thrilling. I loved every second.\" - Taylor Jenkins Reid, New York Times bestselling author of Daisy Jones & The Six",

        "comment": "“Red, White, and Royal Blue” has been in my TBR since I decided to jump back into reading at the beginning of this year. I've been a sucker for \"White House-related” romances since I can remember and this book drew me in like a magnet. But I'm a fantasy junky so I didn't pick up the book until the first trailer for a “RWARB\" movie came forth from Amazon Prime.\n\nFast forward two days before the movie comes out. I had just finished reading another fantasy book and after much debate, I decided I wanted to read the book before watching the movie. So I proceeded to do nothing other than work and come home to completely devour this book.\n\nBy the end of chapter one, I was hooked. This book is unapologetically funny, I've never laughed harder while reading a book, every other page if not every single page. Even the sad or slower pages had me screaming laughter. Casey's comic timing deserves a medal, truly spot on *chef's kiss*.\n\nAs for her charters, Alex is PERFECT!!! His internal battle over Henry, over his sexuality, over his career, is so painfully real. He's so relatable. His charm and personality which he's built over the years, are clearly built for others, not himself. Henry is DREAMY and also painfully perfectly imperfect. Always wearing a shield his family build so no one sees him for who he truly is. Alex being the only person who's broken the shield, finally seeing him the true Henry, not what the royal crown has created of him. I love how hard yet easy it was for them to learn how to take care of and love each other. Henry's anxiety and ticks, Alex's trauma responses. The plot twists are truly delicious. A bit predictable but in the best way possible.\n\nAlex, June, and Nora will forever be one of my comfort trios. How they complete each other. How they protect each other. Each one having a role they play so beautifully it should be a sin. June's relationship with Alex is everything a sibling should aspire to have with their sister or brother. Nora is the kind of best friend everyone wishes they had but is incredibly hard to find in this world. Nora with the emails killed me. Luna and Nora completely sneaked up on me in that chapter but filled my heart with so much joy and love knowing it was Luna, I almost cried.\n\nSpeaking of which, can we just talk about the diversity of this book? Holy crap! Casey truly didn't hold back. Alexander, named after Alexander Hamilton, the mixed son of the first divorced, Woman President of the United States of America. One of Alex's mentors, Raphael Luna, is an openly gay senator who's also Hispanic. How unapologetically strong Zarah, the president’s Chief of Staff. All these people strong and beautiful and portrayed as they should be. All the mentions of gay, bi, etc characters. Nora, Bea, Liam, etc. Again, Perfect.\n\nIs there a little bit of spicy? yes. Is it tasteful? absolutely. I read this book with the audible narrator (which I 1,000% recommend, he's brilliant) and it made the experience 10x better. Nothing was overly explained, They came together and they made love, simple as that. In more words obviously but you get my point. Not really smut, more sensual than sexual. I love smut but this was beautiful and exactly what it needed to be.\n\nIt's almost impossible to put into words how beautifully rich this book is. In story. In love. Inequality. The way the story unfolds reminds me of aged fine whisky, smooth and rich in flavor. Pacing, like the majority of this book, was spot on as well. I was never bored or trying to look ahead, it was incredibly well-paced so I was just living in the moment. Enjoying every page, paragraph, and sentence. Without much effort at all, this book has become hands down my comfort read of 2023, possibly my comfort book forever.\n\nIf you decided not to read this whole thing, I understand, it’s a lot. And it’s more for me than it honestly is for you. But, nonetheless, at least read this sentence. Take this one thing with you. It’s worth it, read it. Enjoy it. Devour it. You won’t regret it!",

        "comment": "Ah the dilemma ... what rating to give this surprisingly addictive (but also frustrating) novel?\n\nI feel helpless admiration for the gorgeous headlong exuberance of McQuiston’s writing, the sheer joy and brash self-confidence of the author's achievement, and its well-deserved commercial success. (The “It’s ridiculous” quotation in my review title is actually the author’s own self-sardonic comment, p. 136, in one of the book's fabulous love scenes.)\n\nThe heart of any romance is the author’s ability to get readers invested in the lead characters and their love story, and this novel soars on that score. Yeah, sure, it’s an absurdly high-concept, escapist, romantic fantasy. But it would take a cold-hearted curmudgeon indeed not to swoon for presidential son Alex Claremont-Diaz, even though, as his British royal counterpart Prince Henry aptly observes, Alex really is a “preening arse” much of the time.\n\nI would second New York Times reviewer Jaime Green’s praise for “the consuming vividness of Alex and Henry” as characters: especially, I think, the brooding and sometimes depressive Henry. As Green says, “the intensity of their infatuation ... is intoxicating.” No sooner did I finish the book than I wanted to read it again, wishing I could induce amnesia so as to enjoy the shock of surprise and discovery all over.\n\nWhile there’s obviously no accounting for taste when it comes to sex scenes (Amazon reviewers seem split between those who find them too much or too tame here), I think McQuiston strikes perfect pitch: deftly and almost entirely avoiding graphic description, while still conveying intensely erotic passion. It’s a fairy tale romance, after all. The goal, I think, is to convey the excitement of sex as primarily centered in the brain, which after all it is. It’s about the feelings, not the bodily mechanics! As a gay man who’s all in favor of more frank and genuinely erotic sexual content in both novels and movies, I say we could use more of this kind of writing. McQuiston shows real innovation here.\n\nBut ... yeah, there’s always a “but” ... as soon as I finished the book I also wanted to rewrite a lot of it. I know, it’s cheeky to tell an author how they might better have plotted and written their own novel, and maybe I’m just jealous I could never in a million years write fiction like this. But take it as a compliment, McQuiston: the very length of this review shows how obsessed I am with your book, how real your characters have become for me. It’s a rare writer of fiction who can achieve that!\n\nSo, the problems ...\n\nOnce you get over the initial romantic rush, the novel is riddled with serious oversights of plotting, character set-up, and seemingly inadequate research. Where were the editors?\n\nIn Shakespeare’s famous love story, Mercutio is actually more interesting than either Romeo or Juliet, and McQuiston offers us a sort-of Mercutio: Henry’s supposed platonic soul-mate, the flamboyant Percy “Pez” Okonjo. But despite this teasing start, he’s totally undeveloped. We get almost no sense of his connection to Henry or how it originated. McQuiston absent-mindedly toys with a romantic attraction between Pez and Alex’s sister June, but never bothers to pursue it.\n\nSo why bother inventing this character in the first place?\n\nAs many of my fellow Amazon reviewers have also noted (more perceptively than major media reviews), the excessive plethora of half-baked minor characters is a pervasive problem.\n\nJune herself, and best friend Nora, fill their roles OK (one wishes for more); the same might be said of Henry’s sister Beatrice. But Alex’s mother (the president) and Henry’s grandmother (the queen) are cardboard cut-outs, as is the president’s hyper-aggressive chief of staff Zahra. Their scenes are stilted, awkward, and neither credible nor interesting.\n\nMy favorite side character is Alex’s dad, who exudes gritty charm in the scenes (too few!) when he takes a bow. McQuiston seems to be fond of Amy the transgender Chinese-American secret service agent, but aside from a few good wisecracks, she’s also a cipher, as is Henry’s “equerry” Shaan, a South Asian Brit who develops an implausible off-stage relationship of his own with one of the Americans (which we are merely told about, not shown).\n\nThere are just WAY TOO MANY minor characters, and their treatment is remarkably uneven. I mean really, why have two named secret service officers perennially assigned to Alex, with neither one developed in any meaningful way? Meanwhile, Henry’s personal protection officers are completely faceless and unnamed, though they must have played an important role in many scenes. Yet we are given totally useless characters that could have been omitted entirely, like Alex’s cubicle-mate on his mother’s campaign, or Henry’s elder brother for that matter.\n\nAnd does McQuiston really expect us to believe that Henry could be the \"Prince of Wales\"? Don’t get me started on his jarringly fake alternative title, \"the Prince of England” (the author toggles inconsistently between the two).\n\n“The” prince? There are LOTS of princes and princesses in the British royal family, and they’re not just “of England” but of the entire United Kingdom, which includes Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, not to mention several nations around the world, including Canada, Jamaica, Australia, and New Zealand, that recognize the British royal sovereign as head of state. And no, this is not nerdish nitpicking. I myself don’t follow British royals, but 15 minutes of Wikipedia research would have helped McQuiston avoid undermining much of the credibility and dramatic tension of the story.\n\nPresumably, most royal-watching readers of this novel DO follow this stuff and are well-versed in the fact that “Prince of Wales” is a unique title ONLY conferred on the heir apparent, which Henry (as McQuiston eventually, confusingly confirms) is NOT. British royal succession law was changed in 2015 to be gender-neutral. And indeed, it is mentioned once or twice that Henry is merely FOURTH in line for the throne, behind his mother, elder brother, and elder sister Bea.\n\nYet, in another scene, Henry contradictorily says his brother is the “heir” and he’s the “spare” (like the real-life Princes William and Harry). No, their mother is the heir (and by the way, would qualify to be “Princess of Wales”), and BOTH his siblings are “spares” ahead of him. Furthermore, his brother gets married at the very outset, so presumably he and his wife will soon start producing children who will bump Bea and Henry still farther down the line of succession. Annoying and completely unnecessary mistakes like this tend to take readers out of the fantasy.\n\nThe deeper question is why McQuiston chose to set things up this way in the first place, so Henry is merely fourth in line and virtually certain NEVER to become king?\n\nWhy not actually make Henry a realistic Prince of Wales? Why not make him FIRST in line for the throne?\n\nWhy make Henry's 80-something grandmother, the queen, so awkwardly similar to the real-life Elizabeth II (who died in 2022, age 96, three years after the novel was published)?\n\nI mean, hello! One of that real queen's grandsons is actually named Henry (nicknamed Prince \"Harry\")! Remember him?! \"Spare\" is even the title used by the actual Prince Harry for his memoir! Similar to the fictional \"Prince Henry,\" the real Prince Harry also became romantically involved with a mixed-race American (a woman), whom he married almost exactly one year before this novel was published. At least change the names for chrissakes!!\n\nWhy not put the crown on the fictional Henry's mother Catherine? She's yet another sadly undeveloped minor character in the novel. The author might easily have imagined a terrorist attack a few years before the story opens to wipe out most of the current royal family, well past 20th or lower in the line of succession. Or just present it as an alternative reality. McQuiston could easily have created a royal family plausibly distinct from the scandal-plagued real one.\n\nWe’re told Henry’s mother is drowning in grief for her late husband. That’s a good plot point, helps explain Henry’s own captivating inner grief and loneliness. But why not make Catherine, the grieving widow and mother, a real presence in the story? She could develop some heartrending terminal condition of her own, thus making Henry more believably fearful of royal duties bearing down upon him at a vulnerably young age.\n\nIf you’re going to set up a high-concept fantasy like this, you need to actually follow it through to its full potential.\n\nMcQuiston did some nice historical research. Henry constantly goes on about Britain’s two known historical gay kings (Edward II in the 14th century and James I during Shakespearean times). So why not link all that to Henry becoming a modern gay king?\n\nThe boys quote lots of real-life historical same-sex love letters to each other, but McQuiston overlooks the historical relevance of the actual King Edward VIII’s famous declaration, when abdicating the throne in 1936, that he “found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge [his] duties as king ... without the help and support of the woman [he] love[d].”\n\nWhat a perfect twist of history if Henry were to say the same thing while DECLINING to abdicate his role as Prince of Wales! With just a few story adjustments, it would have been entirely plausible, in gay-friendly 21st-century Britain, to imagine Alex as a future Prince Consort of the kingdom! (\"Prince Consort\" would also have been a much better title than the silly \"Red, White, and Royal Blue.\")\n\nA big problem with much of the novel is that it obviously would NOT be any big deal for American voters if the president’s son came out as gay or bisexual, and even had an affair with a male British royal. It might be a titillating media sensation for a few days, but the only way it would hurt the president would be if she appeared not to be a supportive parent. Actual former Vice President Dick Cheney, after all, had an openly lesbian daughter almost a generation ago (though granted, she did not cavort with a princess). And would anyone care, in hip and jaded modern Britain, what same-sex dalliances some prince way down in the line of succession got up to?\n\nThus, the entire last third of the novel is a wasted misfire, annoyingly distracting us from the central romance with a wrong turn into American political melodrama and an overhyped outing crisis. How did the author end up deciding that the hook of this novel’s story would be not the future of \"Henrex\" (my original moniker as far as I know!), and their wildly inspiring love, but whether Alex’s mom gets reelected? Rewrite!\n\nWe'll see how the film version turns out, which finished production in August 2022 and is apparently slated to appear on Amazon Prime in August 2023 (I guess they wanted to wait until the coronation of the real King Charles III was well past). Is it too much to hope the screenplay might fix some of these flaws? Probably ... sigh.\n\nBut I still can't get the damn novel out of my head! Looking forward to McQuiston's next!",

        "comment": "I'm going to make a couple reviews on this, one as unbiased as possible and the other as a military wife of 16 years.\n\nThe main male character was a POW in Russia for six months. While there, he was tortured, sexually assaulted, and witnessed extremely horrific things to others in his command. He comes home broken, empty, anxious...a shell of who he once was. He's decided to shift his energy and focus into taking over his billionaire father's company instead of healing.\n\nMain female character is described as a plus sized sunshine. She speaks without filter, smiles a lot, seems indomitable. However underneath all that cheer, she's stressed trying to pay the rent at a care home for her mother who has early onset dementia. She's recently out of a job and panicking.\n\nNext thing she knows she's working for the main male character as his personal assistant and as you would expect, things get heated.\n\nThings I liked-\n\nThe spicy scenes were *chefs kiss*. He takes the whole dominant alpha thing seriously in bed.\n\nIn the beginning I found the dialog cute and funny and entertaining. Little miss sunshine was fearless and friendly and intrepid in all the best ways.\n\nThe whole tortured hero who thinks the sweet heroine is too good for him thing was sweet. The attempts at being decent were sweet.\n\nThe writing style was solid. Editing was solid.\n\nNow to speak as someone married to someone in the military for 16 years and has been immersed in military culture for just as long.\n\nPTSD is no joke. The degree this guy has it is terrifying, his refusal to get real help was reckless and dangerous and even selfish considering how it ultimately impacted those around him. The things he experienced went far beyond a standard deployment, and as details were revealed over the course of the book I was horrified, both with what happened to him but also at the lack of support and understanding of the people around him. Despite their attempts at compassion, the things his friends and family did were highly insensitive and triggering at times. He was home from that horror only two days before he was expected to attend a fancy party on behalf of his sister. I mean who does that to someone after something like that?\n\nNot only was I sickened at him floundering through his significant mental health issues which I won't get into because it would be a spoiler, there is a limit to how bad someone should get before there is no excuse not to get treatment. And when others know about it, they should be encouraging it to. He is a prime candidate for those who unalive themselves and on more than one occasion used words that should have been a red flag in that regard. I'm sorry but the degree of trauma here and the lackadasical response to it was very triggering. There are various secrets revealed over the course of the book and one of the last ones towards the end was extremely serious and worrisome and totally glossed over like hugs and kisses would fix it. I was horrified.\n\nAlso while there are literally thousands upon thousands of romance novels dedicated to walking red flags... and I have loved many of them... I found myself uncomfortable at times with Penny's perception and mental response to some of the things that bordered on abuse that Knight did... I love a good, innocent, sweet, sunshine character but there is a fine like between being sweet and being a doormat. It was at times hard to root for them as a couple...and harder and harder to respect her as time went on and she took everything he dished out rather passively.\n\nAll in all, I found the book to be well written but I did find it quite a bit triggering.\n\nTrigger warnings (if you want them)\nPTSD\nTorture\nSexual assault\nDeath\nMilitary/war/POW\nBDSM\nRough sex/Kinks\nAnxiety\nSevere mental health issues",

        "comment": "First let me preface this review with, I'm a huge fan of L. Steele but I feel that this wasn't one of her better books.\n\nIt was so good....up to the 60% mark. Knight was such a tortured soul as one would expect given what he went through. He was really mean to Penny but she stuck it out because she knew he was dealing with PTSD and was posturing to push her away. She was a ray of sunshine to his darkness. I was totally inline with where the story was going, how it flowed and their chemistry? Out of this world! You knew how Penny felt from the get go and that Knight was beginning to feel things for her he wasn't ready to deal with. This PTSD was a major theme up to this point.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW.......\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAfter their \"fake\" marriage, refused to look at her during the ceremony and also refused to kiss her afterwards then he left Penny in the middle of the reception. He went to a bar and got drunk. Penny went home by herself and Knight's friends dragged him home late totally wasted. He comes into Penny's room the next morning, the poor thing was still in her wedding gown (a tear or two here), with no apologies, to F her into submission. At this point in the story, I was okay because their relationship thus far had revolved around this behavior and we knew why he'd done it. Not excuseable but the reason was well established.\n\nUnfortunately, it went downhill fast from here. It was almost as if Ms. Steele ran out of steam. I don't know happened but the characters began behaving weirdly and flat if that makes any sense. Instead of being righteously angry at Knight for humiliating her at their wedding, she was like \"Oh you want to F? Ok sure! Let's forget everything and get it on. We'll just pretend that never happened.\" And rather than use this as the catalyst for her finally having enough of his BS, she forgave him immediately. What she got mad at and gave his rings back was over the dumbest of dumb things, the fact that he hadn't told her he was trying to adopt the daughter of one of his men that had perished in the mission that had gotten them all captured. Seriously?! Out of all the crap he put her through, THAT's the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back??? And she even admitted to Mira that it was such a noble thing for him to do but because he didn't tell her, she just couldn't live with him any more. And why he was so scared to tell her that, I just couldn't fatham. I just sat there with my mouth open.\n\nKnight did a 180 in his attitude and his feelings for Penny but he made no effort to go after her to explain why he was adopting this little girl and the worse thing? The PTSD was basically forgotten. No explanations on why or how, he just, poof, was over it. It was totally weird and such a let down.\n\nThere was absolutely NO grovel in this book. He did say he was sorry but that was it. And the \"Real\" wife depicted in the blurb? Nope that was a total misconception. She turned out to be the wife of one of Knight's men who had a mental breakdown when she was informed that her husband had perished. In her pychosis, she believed that Knight was her husband. I can understand Penny's shock hearing this woman, who escaped her handler, say she was Knight's wife. That was believable. What wasn't was how mad Penny got even though Knight explained it immediately. Again, another instance of how out of character these two were acting.\n\nI do have to say here that I was so surprised to find out Adam, who was a major player in the book and one of Knight's men who was on the mission with him, and with whom Knight met with everyday, was actually ghost! What a plot twist! I did not see that coming and I LOVED it! Adam also turned out to be the husband of the woman who thought Knight was her husband and the father of the little girl Knight was trying to adopt. Unfortunately, that plot twist was not capitalized on and was over it a matter of one sentence. Such a missed opportunity!\n\nEven though this book turned out to be disappointing to me, I do, as a general rule, love L. Steele's books and I will definitely continue to read her work.",

        "comment": "I loved Maisey and Flint’s enemies to lovers, single mom, fish out of water, anti-relationship with a side of boat loads of baggage romance. They are both such wounded souls that need healing but in order to start the healing, Maisey and Flint must deal with their pasts because their baggage continues to have a huge impact on their lives. The beautifully hilarious and heartwarming story was well written and included witty dialogue, three dimensional relatable and lovable characters who grow, and an engaging storyline. Maisey is a recently divorced single mom who moves to the ranch she inherited from her uncle in small town Hell’s Bells, Wyoming. It’s an escape from her disaster of her old life and an attempt to fix her relationship with her teenage daughter. Flint was a friend of her late uncle and is a renter on the ranch. There is instant chemistry and attraction but Flint’s baggage has long kept him from relationship commitment and Maisey is determined to avoid men until she is finished working on herself. Despite neither one of them being interested in a relationship, each interaction nudges them closer and closer toward their HEA and toward healing. On their way, they have to both learn to let down their walls - to let go of their pasts and who they thought they are supposed to be in order to embrace a life neither one thought was possible. The story will give you all the feels - laughing, crying, swooning, cringing, teeth gritting, and cheering through so many sweet moments, steamy scenes, hilarity, supportive friends, messy families, painful pasts, healing, and all the heart squeezing love.",

There really isn’t any other way to adequately describe just how great the writing, how sweet the story, and how hot the spice. This book filled me with so many feelings, I legitimately squealed out loud and thought my heart was going to spontaneously combust.\n\nMelanie Harlow is a small town romance goddess! I’ve read several of her books, and she knows how to give the readers something that‘s inherently comforting but still always surprising. And I think this one might just be my favorite!\n\nKelly Jo Sullivan just wants a break from her country stardom life as Pixie Heart for a couple weeks, so she rents a secluded cabin in the woods. Unfortunately for Kelly, everyone wants a piece of her, and so her brother hires a body guard to protect her, one she won’t be able to shake. Xander is a former navy seal and a man of honor, so when a buddy who saved his life asks for a favor, Xander says yes. Too bad the last thing Kelly wants on her vacation is company.\n\nIf I tried to name all the parts about this book that I loved, I would basically have to highlight from cover to cover. The push and pull between Kelly and Xander is some of my favorite banter I’ve read in a while, their attraction is instantaneous, and the tension sky high. I love the spice, the way they open up to each other, and the way they challenge each other in the healthiest ways.\n\nBut what makes this book special is the notion of trust. Xander may be overbearing and protective, but he gives Kelly what she needs at every turn. He tells her she can trust him, and then every action backs that up. It’s beautiful to watch because it just makes their connection so much deeper. Xander also makes Kelly trust in herself and her own power, and some of the scenes between them left me speechless with my heart fluttering in my chest. And then he trusts her in return, surrendering himself and his fears to her like he knows she will keep him safe too.\n\nI cried. My heart didn’t know what to do with the emotion and it came out as tears, because I loved this so much and felt so much!\n\nAnd the spice! The spice. This book was dirty and sweet at the same time, and that delicious filth was top notch and scorching hot! So so good, and there was one scene that had me full out sweating! You will know which one when you read!\n\nOverall I don’t have a single negative thing to say except I’m sad it’s over and I’m pretty sure I’m ruined for all eternity because of this! If you love small town romance, rockstar vibes and a kick ass MMC with a sassy firecracker FMC, Drop everything else and read this!\n\nHighly Recommend to ♾️!",

So when his buddy from his SEAL days reaches out to him to guard his little sister who’s a country music superstar, he can’t do anything but say yes. And much to his chagrin, Kelly Jo aka Pixie Hart wants nothing and I mean nothing to do with him! But things change quickly when they’re in a cabin where Kelly Jo is taking a two week vacation from the rigors of celebrity life. Of course, the fact that there’s only one bed just adds to the fun of this book.\n\nThings change quickly for our H/h and holy wowza, their sexy times are hot and sizzling! What I especially loved about their connection, is that there was so much more to it than physically. We see an entirely different side of Xander than we’ve seen previously and Kelly Jo finds an inner strength thanks to Xander. He truly builds her confidence to stand up for herself especially when it comes to her singing career. I adore how she took control of her life thanks to this man that entered her world when she was least expecting it. On the converse side, Kelly Jo truly encouraged Xander to pursue his dreams when it came to the Bar he’s opening. Having read the previous book he didn’t always get the unconditional support he needed and having this woman believe in him made the biggest difference. Don’t get me wrong, his family loves and supports him, but after his SEAL days, they weren’t sure this endeavor would replace the heart stopping moments that being a SEAL did.\n\nTheir path to an HEA isn’t easy. They live in different parts of the country, they’re totally opposite and are at different points in their lives. But where there’s a will there’s a way…. But you’ll need to read this amazing book to find out how this fabulous book made my heart smile!",

        "comment": "As much as I loved Austin and Veronica, I think I loved Xander and Kelly even more. I loved the plot, I loved the characters, I loved the themes, and I loved the writing. I think my favorite parts were Xander’s one sentence chapters, they were perfectly timed and placed.\n\nXander and Kelly had some great banter when Xander showed up and refused to let Kelly fire him. They both seemed to live pushing each other’s buttons and it quickly turned their forced arrangement into something they both craved. I loved that Melanie Harlow took the time to have Kelly and Xander ponder how they’d fallen so hard so fast. They were thrown together 24/7 for two weeks and that allowed them to cram in a lot of feelings that usually took more time to build. They had a strong connection and being alone for any amount of time allowed that to become stronger.\n\nBoth Kelly and Xander were such relatable characters. Kelly was just trying to stand up for herself and have her voice heard. And Xander was the goof of the family that used his unwillingness to feel fear to lead him to some pretty hilarious antics. I loved that Xander helped Kelly see she didn’t have to put up with anyone else’s opinion of her, personally or professionally. I loved that he was able to see what she needed and gave it to her as much as he could.\n\nThis was a great story with plenty of spice. I love that Melanie Harlow always adds cameos of characters from other series’s and I loved getting to see Austin and Veronica again. I loved Xander’s personality and his protectiveness over Kelly, even if he couldn’t admit his feelings yet. I can’t wait for the rest of the Buckley’s to get their HEAs!",

        "comment": "I dove in to see what all the fuss was about. The writing was good. The story flowed and kept you interested. I really liked Zade’s character. I thoroughly admire what he does for a living; human trafficking is unfathomable. I liked the cat and mouse dynamic Zade and Addie had. Everything outside of Addie not giving Zade consent in the beginning. That’s pretty hard to rationalize. Zade even told his friend/co-worker once that his friend didn’t know how listen to the woman’s body instead of her words. I really try to have an open mind when reading and can wrap my mind around a lot of different scenarios. This one was hard, because Addie was truly scared of this stranger lurking outside of her home. And while she does get off on fear, that isn’t consent. So let me just breeze on past that now. When Addie really got over her reluctance to fall for Zade, it was a lot easier to read. She is really smart and understands how crazy her situation is. Her and Daya’s investigation into her Gigi’s murder was interesting and also added to the enjoyment of this story. I like her friend Daya as well. They had a fun, ride or die relationship. The ending is a cliff hanger and I’ll likely pick up book 2 soon.",

        "comment": "Overall, I loved the book. I was craving something SPICY and I will say it gets 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️/5 for Spice. I’d say if you love the smut in books, this one wastes NO time! Probably 69% smut! I also rated it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 because I loved how chapters were told in the perspective of the main characters. I also appreciated how sometimes we would get a chapter from the Manipulator’s perspective and then the next chapter would be The Shadow’s perspective of the previous chapter but then it would continue or give a little more information. It was thrilling to read and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who likes smut, true crime investigations, and Law & Order SVU. JUST READ THE DAMN BOOK!\n\n⚠️Spoilers below!!!!!!⚠️\nLike seriously this is my summary so… expect\nMAJOR\nSPOILERS:\n\nAdeline is an author who falls prey to a stalker. Not just an ordinary stalker, but a tech-saavy, rich, vigilante stalker who ironically saves women and children by day and stalks HER by night. He’s no joke either, he told her not to let a guy at a club touch her, and so to spite him she brings him back to her house for a little woohoo action, well “The Shadow” doesn’t like it and interrupts by banging on her door and then when boy wonder comes out, “the shadow” kidnaps him and kills him slowly, as a punishment to Addie for not listening to him he gifts her a box with boy wonders SEVERED HANDS. The sexual tension and fear slowly build each chapter after that. Hard to believe he did her a favor, but the guy she was hooking up with was actually a terrible guy. Any who, The Shadow - aka Zade- does a bunch of messed up things but then a bunch of hell yeah things so as the reader you end up rooting for him. OH!!! and also while all this is going on, Adeline is trying to solved her GREAT grandmothers murder which also involves a stalker but by the end we realize it was this guy Frank (a man who wanted to be her lover but kills her when he finds out she is cheating and not with him). Oh and she’s doing this with her best friend Daya who happens to work for ZADE doing illegal hacking stuff.\n\nAnyways..the book ENDS with ZADE and Jay having a gun to their heads because the underground ritual was a setup and also Adeline was taken by two mafia guys at the request of Max. Sooo I will have to read Hunting Adeline to find out what happens.\n\nEnding Thoughts: The way this ends makes it seem like Max is the one threatening Jay and ZADE during the ritual after the explosion, especially since he was the one who sent for Adeline to be extracted. Also, does the little girl and Michael survive? I hope they were able to get out. And Daya.. she had to be taken too since she wasn’t answering her phone. Oh boy ZADE is going to be PISSED!!!",

        "comment": "Spicey, steamy and dark, with a perfectly created atmosphere, well-developed characters, and a storyline. Addie’s and Zade’s relationship is toxic, and in reality, I would never be okay with someone I know and/or love being in a relationship like this one. Thank goodness it is fiction! The development of their relationship throughout the book makes it oddly understandable. Zade and Addie own who they are, the good, bad, and ugly. Addie is a strong, independent, and reckless woman. She loves being scared and does not hide that she does not always make the best decisions. Zade is an anti-hero; he saves children and adults from being human traffic while behaving a lot like the people he hunts. He knows what he wants and goes out and gets it. In this case, he wants Addie, and he goes about getting her the wrong way.\nThere is also a secondary storyline, which I found interesting, and connected the past to the present. Also, it gave us an understanding of how Addie became the way she is and the love of the house.\nIf you like DARK, steamy romance, this is for you.\n2 Hunting Adeline (2022)",

        "comment": "I have a lot of conflicting emotions from this one. First off, I loved the author’s writing style. It made me gasp, it made me scared for Adeline but like her… it also made me want Zade. This is a much darker romance than I have read before (and I heard the next one is even darker). I mean, the gun scene. Wtf. 🤯\n\nSpoilers!\n\nAddie I really liked and was relatable for me. I would love to have inherited her home, be a best selling author, I love spooky stuff and would have been her bestie going to the fair with her, too. I also would have fallen for Zade, probably faster than she did. Not sure how I feel about myself admitting that one but there it is. I also loved that she and Daya solved the murder of her great grandmother. That was an awesome side story.\n\nZade is a morally gray character and is not a “nice guy” yet he does do good, admirable things… like rescue people and kids from being trafficked. Yet he then falls for Addie and stalks her and then does sexual things to her with non-con or dub-con. The man is hot though, what he says is 🔥 and their sex is metamorphic. I’d be his mouse. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nI saw the ending coming, I mean there is a second book out and they wouldn’t get a happy ending right away. However, I am still a bit sad about it. Addie doesn’t deserve the hell she is likely to go through in the next book, and Zade is likely going to have to do a whole lot of really bad things to get her back. Also, is Daya okay?\n\nUgh. Okay. On to speed read the next one because I have to know. Pray for my sanity to make it out, too.",

I might take you up on that.”\n“Sounds like my type of forever.” \nThis book had me at every single page, starting litterally at page 1. The above few qoutes are a few of many many qoutes I will forever love. Adam & Rosie? Holy cow y’all. Rosie is a single mama who’s living with her best friend, and she feels like such a burden to those around her, she feels like she’s never been someone’s first choice. Connors (her son) dad is a pos (look that up if you need to) he isn’t a dad. He thinks spending time with his kid is doing a favor for Rosie, he has came and went through out his little life. You can tell from the Begining that his dad doesn’t care, which just makes me mad. Adam comes in and sweeps them both of there feet, yes he lied about hockey? But I don’t put that against him. He felt like he couldnt. I don’t blame him. They have This love that people dream of and they are so damn perfect. (No love is perfect) but litterally reading this story & watching them fall for each other? Ugh I’m obessed. Connor calls adam “dada” from the Begining to, Rosie always says she’s sorry and it’s a phase and whatever. But reading Adams’s pov you know he’s never bothered or upset that he calls him that. Also I could talk forever about this book, but I won’t make you read this review for ever. 🙃\nSome of my favorites? Reading about Adam standing up to Brandon on behalf of Rosie & Connor. Learning that Rosie has been through soo much and is so damn strong, her finishing up get school! I was obsessed with that (yes some things are really sad if you are an animal lover like me be prepared for tears). When Lilly meets Rosie? And Rosie is loving her? Yea I knew that would be the forever type of stuff. When both kids where adams Jersey to the game with daddy & his number. Ugh. 🥺 also at the end when she tells them they’ll need a 5th letter added next to the other initlas 😭\nI cried a lot, but a lot of happy tears!\nBecka Mack knows how to pull us all in & make us love her characters.

I have loved Adam Lockwood since I first read about him in Consider Me, and I have been patiently impatiently waiting for his story and let me tell you that HE. WAS. WORTH. THE. WAIT. I went into this book with high expectations and every single one of them were met!\n\nFirst of all the meet cute was just perfection. I loved Rosie she was just the perfect person for Adam. She was sweet and fierce and she just loved him for him. She also had such similar heartbreak to Adam and I was just in love with both of them from the very beginning. I loved her best friends and how they continued to build her up. I loved that Adam also continued to build her up, he made her feel seen and beautiful and there is just nothing better.\n\nI loved Connor and how he took to Adam so quickly. I LOVED that Adam fell in love with that little boy, all of the scenes with Connor and Adam made my ovaries burst 🫠.\n\nI loved the dogs. Bear and Piglet were just so much fun in the story. I have a dog, but this story made me wish Bear and Piglet were real and that I could adopt them. I loved them with the baby, I loved them with each other, I loved the protectiveness Bear showed for Adam, I loved how much Connor loved Bear and he loved him back. There is a nap scene with Connor, Bear and Adam that will make you melt!\n\nI LOVED seeing my other favorite characters. I love that Carter is still a man child, I love that Olivia is still so fierce and so loving, I love that Cara is still scary and that Emmett loves her so deeply. I love all the inappropriate things Garrett says about Jennie that make Carter crazy. I love Jaxon and the cat. I love the found family. I love that they welcomed Rosie into their family without a second thought and that she felt at home in their chaos.\n\nI loved that this book made me laugh and cry and swoon and blush! The spicy scenes were everything you would want Adam to be! Again, He 👏🏻 Did 👏🏻 Not 👏🏻 Disappoint 👏🏻.\n\nBecka Mack is a magician and I think she sprinkles crack between her pages! I did not want to stop reading this book, I could've read another hundred pages. I actually might need to re-read it soon, I am sure I missed parts. In case you couldn't tell, you really need to read this book!\n\nAlso, Becka teased Jaxon so well in this book, I cannot wait for his story!",

        "comment": "WARNING: Reading this book may make you spontaneously combust. Fox’s latest dark Bratva romance is contributing to the heat wave and global warming, at least as far as my Kindle is concerned. The first seven chapters have you gripping the edge of your seat and chapters 8 and 9, singe your eyebrows as your Kindle turn into an incendiary device. I hope I have conveyed how smoking hot this novel is ❤️‍🔥. Below is a long list of characters with brief descriptions; they are central to this novel and critical to know for “Cognac Vixen” - the conclusion to Cora and Ivan’s story.\n\nCordelia St. Clair - Cora, a young woman who left home to work as a waitress, after her stepfather tried to marry her off to Mikhail Sokolov.\nJorden and Francia Delacour - Cora’s besties and waitresses at a dive called Quintano’s\nAlexander McAllister - Cora’s stepfather, a pompous weasel who is desperate to gain access to organized crime social circles and willing to use marriage to Cora as leverage.\nEvaline McAllister - Cora’s biological mother; cold, worthless, selfish\nMarcus St. Clair - Cora’s biological father, a legitimate attorney\n\nIvan Pushkin - wants to take over as Pakhan so he promised his father that he would marry a “proper” woman, if Otets allowed his sister, Anya marry Lev - a Bratva soldier, but beneath her status.\nAnya - Ivan’s sister\nBoris Pushkin - their father; the obnoxious aging pakhan who is reluctant to relinquish his throne.\nNiles - Ivan’s steward, butler, caretaker who Yasha refers to as the cryptkeeper\nYasha - Ivan’s right hand man\n\nKonstantin Sokolov - head of the Sokolov Bratva\nMikhail Sokolov - Konstantin’s son; and like his father, a sadist and psychopath\nKaterina Sokolov - eldest daughter who was previously betrothed to Ivan, but has gone missing\n\nIvan meets Cora at his home while hosting a party to potentially meet his future fiancée. Cora is posing as Francia, so that she and Jorden can gain access to the party and simply have a good time. Ivan rescues her from a handsy guest who accidentally ripped her dress. Racing away and hiding in Ivan’s office to repair the damaged dress, Cora is interrupted again by Ivan who offers her his jacket. A few drinks later, Ivan has penetrated Cora’s dwindling defenses and he makes a lasting impression on her and vice versa. Read how Ivan finds where Cora works, who she really is and why she’s being targeted for assassination. In order to protect her and her friends, Ivan decides to marry Cora, rather pretend to be betrothed.\n\nThis enemies to lovers romance has the usual Bratva arranged marriage agreements, betrayals, subterfuge, violence and the different families jockeying for the most power. What’s different is that Cora, basically an unimportant young woman and not a Bratva/Mafia princess, is a threat to someone who believes that Cora is actually Ivan’s future bride. Any event that Cora attends, her life is threatened. It’s obvious there is a traitor in their midst and who it is. That was my only disappointment regarding the plot - the predictable identity of the traitor. Both MC’s are well developed, interesting, likeable and in stark contrast to the villains who are deliciously evil. Enjoy another outstanding Bratva duet authored by Fox. She, Anna Zaires, J. T. Geissinger and Zoe Blake are definitely the reigning royalty of dark Bratva/Mafia romances. I have received an ARC from Booksprout and I am leaving an unbiased review voluntarily.",

I didn't see all the twists and turns and was shocked when certain aspects of the story came to light, but it was well with reading this book in less than two days! I have book two and can't wait to start reading, even though I know I will be screaming, crying, alittle angry, and definitely heartbroken because I know something BIG is going to go down, and not everyone is going to make it out unscathed.",

Unless you count his basset hound, Waylon.\n\nKnox doesn’t tolerate drama, even when it comes in the form of a stranded runaway bride.\n\nNaomi wasn’t just running away from her wedding. She was riding to the rescue of her estranged twin to Knockemout, Virginia, a rough-around-the-edges town where disputes are settled the old-fashioned way…with fists and beer. Usually in that order.\n\nToo bad for Naomi her evil twin hasn’t changed at all. After helping herself to Naomi’s car and cash, Tina leaves her with something unexpected. The niece Naomi didn’t know she had. Now she’s stuck in town with no car, no job, no plan, and no home with an 11-year-old going on thirty to take care of.\n\nThere’s a reason Knox doesn’t do complications or high-maintenance women, especially not the romantic ones. But since Naomi’s life imploded right in front of him, the least he can do is help her out of her jam. And just as soon as she stops getting into new trouble he can leave her alone and get back to his peaceful, solitary life.\n\nAt least, that’s the plan until the trouble turns to real danger.",

        "comment": "The Characters & Their Trendy Northern Virginia Town Come To Life In Vivid Detail & Spectacular Dialogue. Fans Of Nicole Snow Will Love The Witty Humor & Writing Style Here. Coffee Lovers Will Delight & Dog Lovers Will Drool In This Darling Story. Don’t Forget To Download The Free Bonus Epilogue Via The Link At The Back Of The Book!\n\nABOUT THE KNOCKEMOUT SERIES:\n\nThis is book one of the Knockemout series. To date, the series includes:\n1. Things We Never Got Over (Knox Morgan & Naomi Witt’s story)\n2. Things We Hide from the Light (Nash Morgan & Lina Solavita’s story)\n3. Things We Left Behind (Lucian Rollins & Sloane Walton’s story)\n\nNamed after a fictional small town in Northern Virginia, the series is full of lively characters, outrageous banter, and lots of steamy chemistry. There are adorable pets and kids that steal your heart. There is also a dose of danger brewing in the background. Geographically, it likely matches up with either real-life Western Loudoun or Clarke County, Virginia. Although the town is vibrant and attracts visitors from nearby Washington, D.C., Knockemout retains its sense of history and a strong feeling of community. It is rumored that the town was named to reflect the way its citizens have long worked out their problems – the good old-fashioned way. They fight it out and move on. The town is like a big extended family, with troublemakers, problem-solvers, and a charitable spirit.\n\nIN THIS BOOK:\n\nThe story opens in August.\n\nNaomi Witt, thirty-six, is the quintessential good girl. A natural caretaker, she never wants to be a burden to others and always puts herself last. She hadn’t anticipated the last-minute road trip to Virginia that brought her to Knockemout. She was supposed to be on her honeymoon with Warner. She is a planner, so the change in plans put her way out of her comfort zone. She has a five-year plan and relies upon a plethora of lists to keep her life on track. She bought a home on Long Island worthy of raising a family and had worked in HR for Warner’s family’s investment firm for five years. Their four years together as a couple and two years planning the perfect wedding had all been for nothing, though. She tried to be everything to Warner, but she lost herself in the process. She realized her mistake at the last minute, and an unexpected phone call gave her the motivation she needed.\n\nFaced with a crisis of her own, Naomi nevertheless dropped everything when she received her estranged twin sister’s call for help. The timing gave her a place to secretly run away to as well as a distraction. Always the people pleaser, Naomi likes to fix problems. Her sister Tina has always been trouble, but Naomi never anticipated what was waiting for her in Virginia. In the year Tina had lived in Knockemout, she had managed to build herself quite a reputation, and as an identical twin, Naomi soon finds herself reaping the results. She doesn’t find many friendly faces.\n\nNaomi doesn’t find her sister, but she does end up as Tina’s latest victim. After having lived through the worst day of her life, the next day isn’t looking much better. Stuck without a phone, car, or credit card, she is dependent upon the kindness of others. Yet nothing could have prepared her for the discovery that Tina had left behind an eleven-year-old daughter – a niece Naomi never knew existed. Doing right by her is never a question. Waylay is tough like her mother, but behind the hard exterior might just be a pre-teen desperate for some normalcy. She is whip-smart but guarded, and Naomi knows that earning Waylay’s trust will be a huge challenge.\n\nNaomi is stuck in Knockemout for at least six months while the custodial arrangement works its way through the legal system. Her entire world pivots as her sense of control is challenged. All of her plans for the future are in upheaval, leaving her adrift with uncertainty. As the locals begin to know Naomi as Not Tina, she begins to settle in. However, there is one particular grumpy Viking of a man that drives her crazy and sets her body on fire at the same time. He is rude and infuriating, and his bad-boy vibe is completely the opposite of Warner's. Almost from the time she rode into town, this man has put himself in the middle of her business, but the last thing she needs with Waylay's custody in limbo is trouble.\n\nKnox Morgan, forty-three, is his own man. His good looks, beard, and tattoos give him the quintessential bad-boy vibe, so women love him in spite of his prickly personality. He does what he wants, when he wants, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Rules are for people like his brother Nash, Knockemout’s Chief of Police. They have a long history of fighting, but they always made up, too. That changed about three years ago, and things haven’t been the same between them since. It breaks their grandmother’s heart. She raised the boys after their mother died, and now what's left of their family is in shambles.\n\nKnox knows good things never last, so anything more than a casual relationship has never been on the table for him. He doesn’t like strings, and he moves on at the first sign of an attachment. He hasn’t been with a local girl since high school, to the disappointment of many. When he is in the mood for a good chase, he heads out of town for a night or two of fun and pleasure. The routine has grown tiresome, though, which might explain his irresistible attraction to a certain newcomer. Little Miss Daisies in Her Hair is not his type at all. She is uppity and needy, and her vocabulary is too big. He hates that he wants her so badly, but if he cannot have her, nobody can – his brother Nash in particular.\n\nKnox came into money a few years back, but he didn’t take it for granted. He has carefully managed his growing portfolio of local businesses, increasing his net worth. He co-owns Whiskey Clipper with his long-time good friend Jeremiah, whose vision has paid off big time. The old barber shop was transformed into a salon that now draws clientele from D.C. A proud barber, people go out of their way to sit in Knox’s chair. He spends most of his time doing managerial work for his various businesses, though. When his business manager, Sherry Fiasco, hires Naomi behind his back, he realizes that he is in deep trouble. The last thing he needs every day is to see Naomi waitressing at Honky Tonk, his bar.\n\nKnox and Naomi have instant chemistry, but things get off to bad start when he confuses her with her delinquent sister. Naomi doesn’t appreciate being yelled at, and she is tired of always playing nice. Despite his intimidating presence, she pushes back, catching Knox and everyone around him off guard. Their crazy banter soon becomes entertainment for the locals. Denying their attraction to one another eventually proves to be harder than giving in to temptation. Knox is stubbornly stuck in his ways, and Naomi is just trying to get by. They agree that whatever they have is a temporary tryst, but then things get complicated. Neither is ready for a relationship. Things move quickly in their rocky ride, but they eventually earn their happy ending.\n\nDon’t forget to download the free bonus epilogue via the link at the back of the book!\n\nBook two, Things We Hide from the Light, follows, in which Knox’s brother Nash gets his happy ending with Lina. They meet here, in book one.\n\nBook three, Things We Left Behind, also gets a brief preview here as Lucian and Sloane’s backstory is hinted at.\n\nWow! Knox and Naomi’s story is a fabulous read. The characters and their trendy Northern Virginia town come to life in vivid detail and spectacular dialogue. Their story really sticks with you, and you’ll quickly be reaching for book two so that you can continue to immerse yourself in the Knockemout world. There were eleven laugh-out-loud moments by my count as well as countless witty excerpts scattered throughout. I also came across eight teary scenes. The couple’s chemistry drips off the page, too.\n\nKnox and Naomi are opposites in so many ways. Knox is gruff and intimidating, while Naomi is kind and well-mannered. Knox wears tattoos and doesn’t always stay within the law, while Naomi wears sundresses and always follows the rules. Knox pushes people away, whereas people are naturally drawn to Naomi. Despite first appearances, however, they actually do have a lot in common. Knox may keep people at a distance, but he is all about giving back. He loves his town, his employees, his friends, and his family, even if he doesn’t know how to express it. His intentions are easily misconstrued since he is generally so unpleasant. Naomi’s selfless personality is more obvious, which makes her a prime target for manipulation. Their shared concern for Waylay’s welfare gives them a distraction from their incessant arguing. It gives them an opening that might not have occurred otherwise because Knox’s general grouchiness sets the otherwise pleasant Daisy off. He triggers something wild and untamed in her – an attribute she abhors.\n\nThere are a few issues that merit mention. First, there are some timeline issues. There is some inconsistency and vagueness that occasionally causes confusion. I looked back several times to verify but had to make assumptions of my own. My takeaway is that the story opened about 2.5 weeks prior to the first day of school, which would be early August, and the story runs its course by October. The bonus epilogue gives a quick peek at the couple with their family and friends five years down the road. Second, Knox’s relationships are supposedly short-lived and casual, but later there are a few statements that make it sound as if he has had a history of actual relationships – implying something more than casual hookups when in fact he always walks away before it gets that far. Third, there is a point at which I couldn’t understand why Naomi hadn’t moved. She had the funds and it would have been appropriate given developments. Fourth, Lina’s nearly two-decade friendship with Knox post-breakup didn’t feel credible to me. I would have expected her to lose interest at some point and stop making the effort. Further, the fact that she never met Nash in almost twenty years of friendship is not at all credible. Nash and Knox have a history of fighting, but it is only the last three years that they’ve not been able to make up. That Lina walks into Knox’s establishment like it is nothing shows Knox has actually brought his out-of-town girlfriends home, or at the very least, he has hung out with Lina in his hometown. In a town that thrives on gossip, that friendship would have been rumored to be more and it would have gotten back to Nash, without a doubt. He would have made it his business to meet her. Finally, I was surprised at Naomi’s outreach to Tina after so much concern about safety had been voiced. It was used to further the plot, but it made Naomi look thoughtless.\n\nKnox and Naomi’s riotous romance will have you in stitches, but don’t forget the tissues. Fans of Nicole Snow will love the witty humor and writing style here. Coffee lovers will delight and dog lovers will drool in this darling story. Naomi is a runaway bride who finds herself heated once tattooed Viking Knox starts yelling and telling her what to do. Their enemies-to-lovers one-night-stand transforms into a fake relationship once things get complicated. The story is smartly written. It is a page-turner from the start, although it does slow down a bit in the second half. The plot is fairly simple. Knockemout comes to life in this story. The characters are wonderfully defined, and the couple’s romantic tension is palpable. There is a large cast of colorful and unique characters. The story is told in first person. The POV alternates between Knox and Naomi. I rate this book 4.5 stars.",

So when she becomes a runaway bride to rescue her evil twin sister, she surprises herself and the whole town of\nKnockemout, Virginia. She is instantly greeted with dirty looks and cold shoulders. The town mistakes Naomi for Tina, who causes trouble in town. Tina is currently MIA but has left something special behind for Naomi, an 11-year-old niece that she didn’t know she had.\n\nNaomi is now stuck in Knockemout with no job, no plan, and a little girl who needs her to figure things out. Knox Morgan, the town “Viking”, cannot handle high-maintenance women and wants Naomi and her sister out of Knockemout. But he also cannot watch her struggle. Knox decides the faster he helps Naomi the fastest she will leave. As Naomi finds herself deeper in trouble, Knox finds himself deeper in love with her.\n\nI surprisingly liked this more than I thought I would! The cover did not grab my attention but everyone’s favorable reviews did. It lived up to the hype! It had so many of my favorite tropes sunshine + grumpy, small-town setting, and forced proximity. Also, there was some drama mixed in with the romance which elevated the plot. Knox is a dreamy book boyfriend and he brought on the spice 🌶️! The one flaw was the main characters act like teenagers when they’re 30th! Lastly, I understand the cover now 😉.",

I live in Northern Virginia outside DC and wish Knockemout is a real town just so I can meet Knox. Tall, bearded, tattooed and grumpy 🥵\n\nSeriously though, I’m glad I finally got around to reading this. It’s refreshing reading a contemporary romance where the MMC is 43 and the FMC is 38, which is close to my own age.\n\nI also really appreciated Naomi’s character. Even though she’s a run away bride from a “wealthier” groom and a huge city, she herself is kind and selfless. While she is a pushover when it comes to her family, she was never a pushover with Knox. The way she stepped up to take care of Way without hesitation is inspiring.\n\nSpeaking of Knox, he really put his foot in his mouth when he met Naomi because he [and the rest of the town] mistook her as her twin sister, Tina. He’s our usual grumpy MMC with bad boy vibes. Just yummy in general.\n\nWay - Waylay - is Tina’s daughter who she left at Naomi’s motel room when she stole her car and money. I really wanted to give her a hug. She was neglected in so many ways that it took her time to feel comfortable with Naomi and trust her.\n\nThe banter between Knox, Naomi, Way, and even the side characters are so fun! Just everybody in their business.\n\nThis is a slow burn between two unlikely people who end up loving each other fiercely. They have a HEA and reading the Epilogue 👩🏻‍🍳💋\n\nI hope you give it a read. I will definitely continue reading the series.",

        "comment": "This was so much more than I expected. Seriously. It’s over and I’m a little sad about it.\n\nBefore I wax poetic about how much I love this book, let me get my “it’s not you, it’s me” out of the way. It is no gripe at the author at all, but I feel compelled to share for those who feel like I do. I love a good sunshine- grump story, but what I super dislike is an h that is so naively sunshine that she dances into Pollyanna territory. Its too much. I can’t take it seriously, and the second hand embarrassment usually makes me quit reading. For about the first 20%, Ava jumped back and forth over that line. It made it uncomfortable for me, but I made myself continue. Zero regrets. Don’t give up on her. She’s so much more.\n\nWhile Ava is the sunshine in this duo, Alec is the darkness. The anti-hero. He’s described as a robot, devoid of emotion. There’s a lot of darkness around him. We learn more about him in bits and pieces as the story progresses, and find that there is indeed a heart underneath all that robot armor. Ava correctly states “ you have a multi layered heart, Alex. A heart of gold encased in a heart of ice.” And the only one who gets to see that heart is Ava.\n\nThere are so many twists and turns in this book. So many lies and deceptions. Ava and Alec both have tragic histories that aren’t exactly as they seem. He has the ability to remember every single moment in time, while she lost all of her childhood memories. While we learn that Alec does indeed have a heart, we also see Pollyanna Ava toughen up and do hard things. She faces her fears, some demons, and learns to stand up and take what she wants. One of the best parts for me was that after everything crumbles, she doesn’t just take Alex back. This is the girl who was assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, and yet immediately afterwards felt bad for HIM. She literally thought “despite what he did, and the things he said, I couldn’t help feeling sorry for him.” Yet by the end of the story, she was not that same little Pollyanna. She did not let Alex waltz back in just because he said “I changed my mind. Now we are together again.” She not only told him no in no uncertain terms, she made him work for it for over a year. A year during which she followed her dreams and he followed her, slowly but surely showing her who he was even when she rebuffed him. It was delicious. I loathe a grand gesture, but give me a good grovel and someone that has to put in the WORK to earn their way back into someone’s good graces, and I swoon. Seriously, even if I hadn’t already been in love with the book that would have sold me.",

Perhaps I should be grateful he never smiled, because if that was what he looked like while doing it… woman-kind didn’t stand a chance.“\nBoth Alex and Ava were fantastic characters. Ava, our FMC, is bright, optimistic, and a truly beautiful soul. She may be a little naïve and often puts her self second to the wants and needs of those she cares about, but her character development was well written as she heads towards a future overcoming her fears and learning to take what she truly wants.\n🩵” Deep, abiding, unconditional love.

He was so much better, even when he tried to convince me, he was worse, and I wanted him like nothing before. Not physically, but mentally and emotionally.

More to come later.\n\nLater:\n\nTwisted Love\nBy: Ana Huang\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️💫3.5/5 stars\n\nI’ve waited to read this book FOREVER after seeing it consistently all over bookstagram this past year. I knew it would be a hyped book and it still delivered for me for the most part.\n\nI read this bad boy mostly in the car ride on our way to Virginia Beach for our first family of 5 vacation. I’ll be sure to read my kindle next time because my underlining/annotating is a MESS😅\n\nAva was a sweet innocent little ray of sunshine with so much emotional trauma/baggage that it was hard to believe it could even be real. She should have been in long term therapy but I’m happy she was able to overcome her fear of water and stood up for herself in the end.\n\nNow Alex, oh Alex. Why am I always so attracted to the deeply psychopathic morally grey men? He checks all the boxes: rich, smart, sexy, possessive, protective, murderous, and revenge driven. I loved him honestly and cared about his story more than Ana’s.\n\nI feel like his sexual preferences were totally not for Ana and she kind of went with it because he’s insanely hot and made her feel safe, even while annihilating her in bed and using dirty talk that would make your mother pass out. But that’s the thing right? She’s light and he’s dark and they’re suppose to just mesh into perfection, I guess?\n\nI feel like this book crammed so many book tropes into one and it hit some marks but overall wasn’t what I expected from such a hyped book. I’m going to keep reading the series because I am easily influenced🤷🏼‍♀️ Here’s hoping Bridget and Rhys give me more of what this series promised!",

        "comment": "I absolutely LOVED this book! Renn and Blakely were so perfect for each other. Renn's the best friend of Blakely's older brother Brock. They've known and been attracted to each other for many years, but neither has ever acted on that attraction. Ella, Blakely's best friend, has an on-again, off-again relationship with Brock. The girls go to Vegas to celebrate Blakely's 30th birthday. Blakely's made the decision that she wants to concentrate on herself and meet her goals of finding a nice man who loves her, marries her, and beginning a family. Brock and Renn crash their girls' weekend. Brock is intent on making up with Ella, so Renn and Blakely go off on their own to give them time alone. The following morning they wake up in the same bed to discover that, while inebriated the night before, they got married. Renn and Brock are professional rugby players and the paparazzi has already found out about the sudden marriage. Renn has a bad-boy reputation and his contract with his current team has a clause that stipulates he avoid negative publicity. He's always avoided relationships in the past and his not-totally-accurate reputation has consisted of one-night stands and short-term flings. A quickie marriage followed by a quick divorce will jeopardize his carreer, so Renn and Blakely agree to stay married for 90 days pretending to be happy newlyweds before dissolving the marriage. In the meantime, they continue to enjoy the sexual perks of their marriage and long-buried feelings begin to emerge. This was a great romance and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I sincerely hope the author is going to write stories about the Renn siblings who were introduced in this one. Plus, it was a pleasant surprise that Foxx was a secondary character in this one, too. I'm so looking forward to his upcoming book, Flame.",

        "comment": "Oh please, please, please tell me there's going to be a Brewer family series and that this won’t be a standalone! We get just enough of Renn's siblings in his romance that I have to have more. And I’ll let you in on a little secret. We also get a tiny bit of insight into the elusive Foxx Carmichael, just in time for his upcoming story in Flame.\n\nThe story starts from Blakely Evans' POV, the younger sister of Renn's pro rugby teammate and best friend, Brock. Blakely and her BFF Ella are in Vegas celebrating Blakely's thirtieth birthday, but their girl's weekend is crashed by Renn and her brother Brock, who is on-again-off-again with Ella. While Brock and Ella are getting back to on again, Renn and Blakely are out on the town, having g fun, and drinking way too much. Sooo, the next morning they wake up in the same bed, married.\n\nBut Blakely has decided her thirties will be a time of finding the right guy who has forever in mind. She wants to get her life in order, do responsible things, and settle down. And what does a charming, swaggering, player who only looks as far down the road as right now have to offer?\n\nThese two have been flirting and circling around each other for ten long years, but neither ever made a move. Finally, they’re in a situation where they get the chance to see each other through fresh eyes and consider what forever might look for them.\n\nGah y'all, this one is so freakin' good!! Renn and Blakely are perfect together, and I loved the side romance with Brock and Ella. And Renn's family? There's some complicated stuff there, but they’re so welcoming to Blakely, and she finally has a chance at having the family she's longed for. I fell head over heels for these two and have no doubt you'll adore them as much as I do. Funny, charming, steamy, and full of heart, you won’t want to pass up this one!",

        "comment": "This book was exactly what Adriana Locke intended it to be, a great escape from reality. It was lighthearted and fun and had plenty of humor and banter. It was a great foundation for the Brewer family, even though this was supposed to be a stand alone, the secondary characters were great.\n\nRenn and Blakely were a great example of right person, wrong time, until they ended up married in Vegas. They had exchanged in banter for years but it took a Vegas wedding an a proposal to stay married for 90 days to show them both what they had been missing. The tension between them was explosive and I loved getting to see them both realize how deep their feelings ran.\n\nThis was a great spin on the brother’s best friend trope. I also loved that there was a background romance going on between Ella and Brock at the same time as Renn and Blakely’s romance. I love a good misunderstood hero, and Renn was definitely that, but more than that, I loved how Blakely’s feelings changed when she saw the man Renn was.\n\nThis was a great summer read. Blakely and Renn were refreshing and fun but still had some tension and underlying emotional problems to work through. And I absolutely loved getting a glimpse of the mysterious Foxx Carmichael!",

        "comment": "Blakely and Renn have known each other for 10 years. Blakely, however, is off limits to Renn because she is his best friend's little sister. It's Blakely's thirtieth birthday in Vegas and Renn and Blakely's brother Brock crash the party. A few drinks in and Blakely and Renn are left alone and that's when a whoopsie happens! Marriage on the Vegas Strip that neither of them remember. Should they stay together or get an annulment?\n\nThis story is a page turner, I didn't want to put it down. Adriana Locke writes big families well, probably because she created one with her own husband in real life. I laughed and cried and was so incredibly uplifted by the end of this book. Life can be so hard and I can tell Adriana wants to put a smile on her readers faces. This book did just that for me. Plus Foxx from the Carmichael series is in this one and now we know what his job is! Can't recommend this book enough!",

        "comment": "There were a lot of moving parts in this second book which kept things going and fast paced.\nThe book starts off with Cora having recently been kidnapped and now once again a prisoner of her previous fiance and stepfather. And Ivan has been blackmailed into an engagement with the surprise villain of book one- Francie.\n\nLike the first book I felt this one was equally well written, fun and entertaining.\nWe were treated to some growth on the part of Cora learning to rescue herself and Ivan learning to give into his feelings.\n\nOnly thing that threw me was some of the Bratva stuff. Ivan is the Pakhan (top boss) but he seems to handle almost everything himself. I kept wondering how many people he had in his Bratva. Throughout both books he, his woman and his home were under-guarded and underprotected. He also seemed to feel powerless to go get Cora, focusing on diplomacy a lot of the time which also made me question how big and strong of a Bratva he actually had.\n\nI was also confused as to why he allowed certain psychotic characters to live and walk away repeatedly which resulted in repeated attempts on his and his woman's life and freedom. At times I was nearly yelling at the book the way you do when a girl in a horror movie goes down the dark stairs alone to investigate a noise lol\n\nDespite that aspect, I really loved this duet. It was an enjoyable read. The ending was sweet and perfect. I look forward to more books by this author.",

        "comment": "The author deftly weaves steamy sensual scenes between our MC’s with wrapping up all the loose ends left in “Cognac Villain”. Readers will see what happens with the Solkolov’s (particularly Mikhail), Cora’s stepfather, her biological father, her piece of 💩 mother, and finally Francia. Fox tortures us with how long it takes to deal with Francia. If I had my way with writing a satisfying resolution to dealing with all of these villainous psychopaths, it would have included a BAZOOKA! It was still a treat to see how Francia, the unhinged betrayer, was betrayed.\nWe also are also treated to the revelation of Yasha and Jorden’s intimate relationship. Yasha is a study in incongruity - a funny henchman. He’s the comic relief in one disaster after another. In the final chapters, Jorden and Cora share more than just a friendship. Finally, our HEA is emphatically punctuated with a terrific bonus epilogue with my favorite supporting character - Niles, and a pile of new little people. Fox does it again…another sensational Bratva romance. Should we be surprised? Nah! 😜. I have received an ARC from Booksprout and I am leaving an unbiased review voluntarily.",

But everything changes when she discovers that Hunter is cheating on her—and she’s forced to decide what her next move should be.\n\nSoon, Sydney finds herself captivated by her mysterious and attractive neighbor, Ridge. She can't take her eyes off him or stop listening to the passionate way he plays his guitar every evening out on his balcony. And there’s something about Sydney that Ridge can’t ignore, either.

        "comment": "‘There are only twenty-six letters in the English alphabet. You would think there would only be so much you could do with twenty-six letters. You would think there were only so many ways those letters could make you feel when mixed up and shoved together to make words.’\n\nYes, you would think, but then Colleen Hoover comes along and with just a few simple words she’ll leave you stunned and wondering how someone can say something so simply yet have you feel it down to the bottom of your soul. That’s how I felt while reading this book and I found myself in awe of what she created with this story. It was so simply written, yet so ridiculously deep and meaningful. I could not put it down!\n\nI’m not going to spoil anything because discovering the quirks and twists as you go is half the fun here but here’s a quick (spoiler-free) summary of the groundwork for the story. Sydney has been listening to Ridge from her balcony for a few weeks as he plays his guitar on his own balcony across the courtyard. She finds herself making up lyrics to his song and is highly embarrassed when she realizes that he’s been watching her too and has noticed her singing along to his songs that don’t yet have lyrics. This is convenient for Ridge because he’s recently been suffering writer’s block and has been unable to come up with any lyrics for his and his brother’s band. He gets her to text him and he begs her to share her lyrics with him. Sydney reluctantly agrees and it would seem that she is the answer to his prayers because her lyrics are amazing. When Sydney suddenly finds herself in need of a place to stay she ends up roommates with Ridge and they start to bond over their combined songwriting. That’s about all I’ll say because from that point on NOTHING in this book was what I expected.\n\nI don’t know what exactly I was expecting going into this book, but it wasn’t anything like what I got, because what I got was so much more than I could have ever imagined! This story surprised me at every turn, made me feel so deeply and question myself as I went through the same struggles as the characters did. This book really makes you think and I guarantee it will leave you so conflicted with how you hope things will turn out, because truly there isn’t a villain in this story, they are all just victims of their circumstances and poor timing. (“There isn’t a doubt in my mind that we could be perfect for each other’s life, Sydney. It’s our lives that aren’t perfect for us.”) You become so invested in all of the characters that you just don’t want to see anyone hurt, even the ones they aren’t “supposed” to be with. It messes with your head a little bit because usually you know who the main couple is going to be and you root for them throughout, in this book I completely understood how a heart could be split in half and given to two people equally. She writes it so perfectly and as I went I felt my heart was split in two for this story too. I can’t really go into details without spoiling the story, but I think if you read this you will understand what I mean.\n\nI loved the use of music here as a means for Sydney and Ridge to connect. Because of a certain aspect of Ridge, the way they communicate through their lyrics and the feeling of the music itself is just so powerful. I was left speechless time and again at the beauty of the bond they formed by sharing this. Regardless of whatever else was going on or the status of their ‘romantic’ relationship, no one else could touch this bond. Neither one of them had ever felt that before with another person and I felt their connection very deeply, it was breathtaking how it was all woven together and through Colleen’s masterful writing it was just amazing. It was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at times seeing them develop this relationship that was so intimate, but not in the way you might imagine. I’ve never read anything like it.\n\nOne thing I’ve loved about every Colleen Hoover book that I’ve read is how alive her characters are, they are so well written and well-rounded that they just jump off the page and I feel like they could be any other group of friends living down the street. Their reactions, their interactions, their thoughts and actions are all so realistic and relatable that it’s impossible not to connect with them and fall in love with them. That’s how it was with this crew, I fell in love with Ridge, Sydney, Warren, Bridgette, Maggie and Brennan. What a fun group of friends! I loved how they all interacted and their pranks were hilarious! Warren cracked me up and I think he summed it up best here: “Well, Sydney. Welcome to the weirdest place you’ll ever live.” I loved that! They weren’t perfect though and they made mistakes that I think anyone in their position would make but they were honest and real reactions. And I found that the way they dealt with their mistakes or issues was very mature and refreshing for a New Adult book.\n\nI highly recommend getting the companion soundtrack by Griffin Peterson and having it handy when reading this book! I downloaded it from iTunes right as I started reading and when I came across the songs in the book I would play it and it just added a whole other dimension to this story. It was awesome hearing the songs come alive and I actually really liked the music. I love that through her art, Colleen Hoover is supporting other artists as well and I love that she creates these complete experiences and takes it beyond just the words on her pages. It’s a unique experience and I really enjoyed it. Also, check out the Maybe Someday page on her website (http://www.maybesomedaysoundtrack.com/extras.php) because there’s a link to unlock a bonus epilogue which made my heart happy to read! I was happy with how the actual book ended but this just completely rounded it out for me.\n\nThis book is going up there with my top favorite reads! It was fresh, surprising, profound and heartfelt and really just a wonderful book! And if you’re not ready to leave this crew yet I would recommend checking out Maybe Not once you’re done with this because that was a quick, fun read that’s perfect to jump into right after this!\n\n‘And if I can’t be yours now\nI’ll wait here on this ground\nTill you come\nTill you take me away\nMaybe Someday\nMaybe Someday’",

Yet, he is the song writer for a popular band. He plays the guitar on his balcony every evening attracting the attention of Sydney who just happens to be a musician. With her ability to write lyrics for his music, they become successful. Since he is deaf, the communicate by text or computer. Their experiences when the songs become quite romantic are the stuff of which dreams are made. But, all is not hugs, kisses, and ever after because he has a girlfriend whom he truly loves. This causes giant heartache for both of them. A dramatic late night near death becomes a wake up call and sets in motion would searching drama that provides a definition for love. You will be greatly moved by what happens. You will enjoy the story, but watch out for Warren!",

        "comment": "You guys I’m not even sure this review is going to make any sense, but I’m going to try to sort through my thoughts. First off, let me say that out of all of Colleen Hoover’s books, Maybe Someday is the one I was most excited for and most looking forward to getting. Music was such a big influence in my own developing relationship with my husband even before we started dating and leading all the way up to our wedding. Because of this, the idea of reading a book that even kind of has a similar storyline—two people falling in love over music, being able to say through the lyrics of a song what they can’t bring themselves to say to each other’s faces—was something that I was ecstatic about. But I’ve also discussed a bit in the past about how my expectations can alter how I feel about a book. All of that being said, I think Maybe Someday needs a slightly different process for my review. I’m going to break this down.\n\nCover: 4/5 – It’s not necessarily the most visually appealing book cover necessarily for me. By that I mean had I just been browsing books by cover and didn’t know anything about the synopsis or about Colleen Hoover, I’m not sure if I would stop on this one to check it out or not. However, this cover definitely covers the span of the book. The way Ridge’s hand covers Sydney's. The sheet music. And the kissing shown through the letters. It all spells out the key things you need to know.\n\nOriginality of Overall Concept: 5/5 – While the idea of using song lyrics in a book is not completely original, the idea of having an all original soundtrack, with actual original songs performed and recorded…yeah that’s completely original. And to be honest it’s one of those “I wish I had thought of that” moments.\n\nMusic: 4.5/5 – Reading the lyrics within the story made sense, but there was just something missing. Once I scanned my QR Code and listened to the song WHILE reading the lyrics it made so much more sense. The music behind the lyrics does so much to set the tone. I’m not 100% sure that I would seek out every one of these songs were they not connected to this story, but there are definitely several that need to be added to my regular play list. (Sidebar- Griffin Peterson…you need to get your music on Pandora. Thank you very much.)\n\nCharacters: 4/5 – How I feel about the main characters, Sydney and Ridge, is so completely tied to how I feel about the story itself. So I’ll discuss that later. The side characters were fleshed out as most of Colleen Hoover’s side characters are. Warren was my favorite as I’m sure most people will agree. Bridgette, Tori, and Brenan didn’t make enough appearances for me to firmly establish much feeling about any of them. Hunter was a huge DB. And Maggie…well…I’m not really sure how I felt about her. Would I be surprise if Maggie gets her own book? Absolutely not. Would I read that book? I most certainly would.\n\nStory: 4/5 – Oh guys. There’s so much I want to say, but where is the line? You know? What’s considered a spoiler and what isn’t? Maybe Someday’s storyline was not what I expected at all. And to be honest that’s not really meant in a good way. We already know from the description above that cheating is involved in this book, but what I didn’t know was how prevalent of a role it would have in the overall story. It sounded like something that happens early on or maybe even before the story begins and is just something that Sydney is dealing with emotionally, but cheating is more of an ongoing topic for this book. While I felt like Colleen Hoover’s portrayal of events was true to real life, I found myself not fully feeling like I could root for these characters like I had hoped to be able to do. And so much of how I feel about this book is wrapped up in the topic of cheating that I feel like I can’t really discuss the book itself without giving too much away or without going on a complete tangent about the evils of unfaithfulness.\n\nI understood Sydney. I could feel what she was feeling, yet I couldn’t fully support her. And I couldn’t fully merge myself with her. I did find that Sydney cried a lot which is another thing that’s difficult for me to relate to. At this point in my life, I’m not an easy crier. And this is actually saying a lot because I think I’ve at least teared up reading every single one of Colleen Hoover’s other books.\n\nRidge. I both loved and loathed him. I fell in love with his talent for music and a few other characteristics. I always find guys who are talented in the arts some way to be extremely attractive. Ridge was no exception. However, I actually couldn’t understand how he felt and acted and behaved as much as I could Sydney. I felt like he got off easy. What I mean by that is that every time he would have been forced to make a hard decision I felt like the cosmos would give him an easy out. Or maybe he would make a hard choice between two different paths, but then one of the paths would come to a dead end so he was forced to backtrack and then take the other path thus essentially making his decision for him.\n\nAt one point toward the ¾ mark, I was really starting to get upset because I felt like there was no path these characters could take that I would be satisfied with. In the end, I was okay with how everything wrapped up except for the pieces that felt “too easy.” While Colleen Hoover definitely made me feel a lot of emotions through this book, I’m not sure they were all emotions that I wanted to feel.

    "synopsis": "Carter Beckett is the NHL’s resident bad boy, top player both on the ice and in the bedroom, and quite possibly the sexiest man to ever grace my field of vision. But worst of all? He knows it.\n\nHe’s arrogant, self-centered, and the man doesn’t seem to know what a filter is, let alone how to use one. He’s had everything served to him on a silver platter, including endless strings of women, and apparently, I’m up next.\nHis only problem? I have no intention of falling for his shi—um, charm.\n\nI have the solution to all my sexual frustrations in a drawer at home, and it’s far less complicated than Carter Beckett. Sure, he may be pretty, but he’s also a walking, talking reminder for you to wrap it before you tap it.\n\nBut then I start letting my guard down, and he starts showing me pieces of himself I had no intention of seeing. The bricks surrounding me may be tumbling down one by one, but I’m not sold yet, which means for the first time in his life, Carter’s the one begging.\n\nFor my time, my trust, for a single chance.\n\nFor me to just…consider him.\n\nConsider Me is book #1 in the Playing For Keeps series, a series of interconnected standalone mature hockey romance stories that contain lots of heat, swoon, laughs, and a ride on an emotional rollercoaster!",

        "comment": "Hello everyone please drop everything and read this series IMMEDIATELY\n\nNow that that’s out of the way let’s talk about the first book.\n\nCarter Beckett is.. something. He’s a cocky playboy who’s never had a girlfriend. He’s looking for meaningless hookups with different girls every night. Until he sees her. He sees this tiny little brunette who changes his world. As Carter Beckett does, he puts on his best face, and goes to ask Olivia to hook up. He simply cannot believe it when she turns him down.\n\nOlivia has been warned about playboy Carter Beckett, I mean who hasn’t? Just check the latest gossip columns. She quickly turns him down and goes about her business but he just can’t seem to get the hint. There’s no way she would say yes..is there?\n\nCarter is PINNING for Olivia from the beginning of the book and frankly it’s hilarious. This man is so down bad. He has stopped hooking up with girls as he focuses on the one and only Olivia Parker. Carter trying to get Olivia to noticed him is genuinely so wholesome and funny. If I say he’s obsessed and won’t stop til she says yes you definitely get the wrong idea but trust me this is too good.\n\nThe beginning had me laughing, the middle had me smiling, the end had me tearing up. These two are just so cute and I love them so much. Carter is ready to settle down with Olivia and he’s such a cute boyfriend. Their interactions are so funny and eventually turn spicy. It’s just the relationship you want to read about.\n\nThere’s some more serious topics discussed such as loss of a parent and insecurities. The topics feel well done and add to the story. I genuinely just love this book so so much.",

        "comment": "Loved it, loved it, LOVED it! You know things are going VERY well when the 20-hour runtime on an audiobook doesn't phase me, and I spend time doing math to determine whether it's physically possible for me to stay up late enough to finish before going to bed (sadly, no). I really wasn't sure what to expect from this new-to-me author, but I'll admit that I'm a softie for a manhoe who is smacked upside the head the moment he meets the right girl - and that is exactly what this story is all about. The hero at the heart of it undergoes SUCH a transformation from start to finish, and I absolutely adored seeing him work to earn his girl's trust and love. The intimidating length is actually perfect in this instance, because this hero is working so hard to prove himself, persisting through stumbles and obstacles along the way. Mack does an excellent job of showcasing the growth in intimacy, the build of the relationship, and puts it to the test to make sure they got it right. There are SO MANY swoony, tender moments, which pair perfectly with the intensity of emotion and the delicious spice. It's raw, real, and just the right kind of heart-wrenching, and I loved every single minute of it.\n\nThe story follows Carter, a hockey star with a playboy reputation that he doesn't try to hide. No woman has ever made him want to change his ways, and he values his privacy and alone time, so casual encounters have always made the most sense. At least... until he meets Olivia. Intensely attracted to her from the moment they meet, it doesn't take long for Carter to pursue her. But when the sassy brunette resists his advances, it makes Carter work harder - and spending time together makes him realize that he wouldn't mind taking a chance with her. Unfortunately, Olivia is well aware of Carter's reputation, and she can't trust that his sudden change of heart is the kind that will last. Never did Carter think that his playboy ways would catch up to him in such a major way, and now he has to earn the trust that Olivia is so hesitant to give.\n\nI've had this on my kindle for a few months, and it wasn't until the audio version released that I decided to take the plunge. Devoting 20 hours to a book by a new-to-me author is always a little risky, but I am SO GLAD that I took the chance on this one. Playboys always seem to fall the hardest, and that is definitely the case here. I loved getting to know Carter, and seeing him be totally gone for his girl was immensely fulfilling. This balances swoony moments with drama and angst, ratcheting up the tension in all the best ways. We see Carter WORK for what he wants, and that was such a breath of fresh air. The page count was required to truly see their progression from strangers to lovers to soul mates with the strongest of bonds. And having a smitten hero is its own reward, with some incredibly heartwarming moments between them... and plenty of hot, SPICY moments as well. It's such a journey from start to finish, and I can't believe how engrossed I was the entire time.\n\nAudio note: I highly recommend the audio! I'd never heard of either narrator before starting, but they both give great performances in this dual narration audiobook. The female narrator gives a solid performance, but it's the male narrator who really takes things up a notch. He embodies Carter perfectly, this sexy hockey bro who is out of his element. Listening to the narration was a definite upgrade from simply reading the text, and it also helps makes the experience more immersive. I can't say that I recommend this as a workday listen though - there are steamy situations throughout, lots of language, and, honestly, the story is so good that you might find it too distracting to work, lol. At least I did. The runtime is also prohibitive, because 20 hours means you'll be listening for AT LEAST two days, probably more. So it's much more conducive to a weekend binge, but definitely worth the experience.",

He is so use to being the hot shot playboy that he is caught off guard by his attraction to Ollie. Olivia (Ollie) knows all about Carter and his way with women. She doesn’t fall for his charm the way most girls do. She is small but her attitude is anything but. They both take a risk of heartbreak, trust issues and ultimately love. I like how this book had hard times and it took your through how they navigated through it and came out stronger in the end. Carters golden retriever energy is unmatched, the way he loves Ollie. Big, loud, unapologetic. When a book takes you through an array of emotions, happy, sad, angry and sobbing it’s always a winner right?\n\nThe only reason for missing star is because I felt it could of been slightly shorter and would of still been a great book!",

Carter as a character is so endearing as he develops throughout the book. She really got you hooked in to all the sweet ways he was attached to Olivia. I don’t always like instalove but I understand why it was necessary for the plot. There were times Olivia had me on the edge of really despising her (because she couldn’t comprehend how Carter could choose her), but the author pulled back just in time to show growth in her character.\n\nI hated the “conflict” because it just seemed so easily solvable, but I understand why it was the way it was. It beautifully portrayed how much both of them had grown throughout the book and their relationship. Hoping the rest of these books deliver the same quality of writing and character development. Hoping I found a new favorite author.",

And the slow burn to get there was excellent and well worth the wait. I also loved the cozy small-town setting and the other family members.\n\nThe spice in this book was incredible.

I thought that I wouldn’t enjoy this book as much as the first one but wow this one was sooo much better in my opinion. In the first book you get a glimpse of Cade Eaton and just think he’s the older grouchy douche brother but when you get to his book, you realize all of the responsibilities and pressure he had to face, especially when he was left alone to care for his son Luke😟. So he hides his soft and caring side with pretending to be the most grouchy and grumpy person. Lol That is until he meets his match by our beautiful copper haired girl Willa! Willa is not only beautiful but she is the outspoken, free willing and free loving best friend of Summer. She is so hilarious but also she can sing and play the guitar!! What a win!!! What unfolds is one of the funniest, sweetest, very very hot, tearjerking love story!! I love how Cade can’t help but slowly fall in love with Willa! He cannot resist her charms, quirkiness and kindness! We also get the cutest relationship between Luke and his dad Cade and Luke with his nanny Willa! Just overall love this story so much! Definitely on my top favorite books! Also side note: I loved that they didn’t make their issues and problems drag on like some other stories tend to do. Very straightforward!

Also bring tissues because you will cry laughing.\n\nCade is a complex character with SO much heart. Make him a doting, attentive single dad? Add in that he is one assertive, dirty talker in the bedroom? SOLD. I'll hand in my feminist card. Right the heck now.\n\nBut let's talk about the FMC, Willa MF'ing Grant. I have NEVER felt more connected to, more attached to, more want-to-be-BFFs-with-a-fictional-character than Willa.

Check. Possessive? Check. Filthy mouth? THE FILTHIEST. When I say Cade Eaton is swoon worthy I mean get me a couch cause I am about to FAINT.\n\nWilla is the perfect other half to Cade. Loyal, feisty, caring. Who doesn’t love those attributes?? I feel as if she is a wonderful choice for the leading female in this story. Her sense of humor and the tension she felt with Cade were TOP KNOTCH.\n\nThis book is all about loving someone even when it’s hard, even where you’re scared, even when you feel like you don’t deserve it. The character developments are written beautifully and the spice is SPICY! I’d say a 4/5 🌶️ for the “forbidden” vibes and the absolute debauchery that comes out of Cade Eatons mouth.\n\n10/10 recommend this book.

I can’t remember if I first noticed you in my feed or booktok🤔 either way, this book has popped up several times and I was finally ready to read it as I gobble up everything hockey romance (like the rest of the world, I know) right?\nThis book had a fantastically perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I truly can’t think of a book that had a better blend. Don’t get it twisted, this does NOT me the spice was skimped on. Uh, that would be a NO. Holey-moley would you be wrong. It was spïcy AF! I’m talking’ 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️💦🥵😮‍💨. There was some praise kïnk, alpha male naughtiness to boot. Then the sweet made my heart ache, wanting that for myself…yeah, this book literally had it all.\nOur h was so warm, and caring. Optimistic it broken. She was beautiful from the inside out but lay someone convince her otherwise. She followed her boyfriend and his dreams, helped him realize them even only to have him dump her after her usefulness ended…so he thought.\nThen we have our H who only had him and his mom always. He took care of mom growing up as she suffered from some mental health needs he was not equip to handle being a child. The need to fix and protect stayed with him and one major situation with his now ex-girlfriend made him swear off serious relationships forever and just focus on hockey (a team he took a pay cut to be at for his mom) and his mother directly as she just can’t get it together mentally on her own.\nThis sets us up for a journey of hope and triumph. Love and alpha male 😂!!! The secondary characters in this book rocked hard too! I can’t WAIT to see if they have stories too!\nAll in all a smashing success of a 1st read for me!! 5 stars mean I’m buying this physical book as it will stick with me a long time and excited to read any back catalogue by Stephanie. 🥰🥰🥰",

        "comment": "This was a solid 4 stars for me; I enjoy Stephanie Archer’s style and I’m definitely pre-ordering the next book.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-Stephanie Archer’s books are generally easy, breezy, fun books to read. If you, like me, enjoy turning your brain off for a while and read a book to decompress, this is the author for you. I love the Queen’s Cove series and I was looking forward to this, too.\n-Pippa and Jamie both likable characters. Actually, all the characters are pretty easy to like and are well developed.\n-DAISY!!\n-Jamie’s nickname for Pippa is adorable. All the flashbacks to their high school days are so freaking cute!\n-The steam was good. I feel like steamy scenes, especially featuring dirty talk, are hard to get right and Stephanie Archer consistently nails it. It doesn’t feel unrealistic or have so-bad-it’s-hilarious dirty talk.\n\nWhat I didn’t like:\n-Low/no stakes: while I enjoy her style overall, I felt like this book had a problem in that so many things that would have made me more invested in the characters happened off-page. We are told what happens instead of shown. Like, Jamie defends Pippa’s ambitions in front of her parents, but we don’t actually see this happen. Maybe it’s just me, but I get attached to characters by going through their experiences with them; mentioning something central to the characters/their relationship in passing makes the experience….more bland than breezy.\n-Hotness: yes. We get it. You are both stunningly attractive people. It almost felt like that’s all they were because it was mentioned so many times. He kept referring to her as his “pretty assistant” well after their relationship was established; which I thought was strange. See above about mentioning important event but not being “shown”. We were shown that they are hot ad nauseam. Maybe it’s just me. I didn’t feel like any of her other books had this issue.\n-I actually agree with Pippa’s parents (but I’m also the type of person who desperately wanted Ferris Bueller to be caught, that jerk): it’s easy to pursue your dreams when you have a hot, rich partner to ensure you don’t starve. The fact that Pippa didn’t even really address it when she should know exactly how the music industry can be makes her seem a little vapid, like she’s a privileged girl who has never really had to struggle for anything in her life.\n\nNot my favorite Stephanie Archer book, but it’s still a Stephanie Archer book and I happily devoured it whole. I will also happily pre-order the next one.\n\nI was provided an ARC in exchange for an honest review.",

        "comment": "This is my first Stephanie Archer book. For the most part, I loved it. I loved the story. Jaime and Pippa had incredible tension and chemistry. He was pretty horrible to her in the beginning, but she handled it so well. Even though she was heartbroken and betrayed by her ex (and it clearly messed her up), she never once felt sorry for herself. She was thoughtful and funny and I truly loved everything about her.\n\nThe pacing and build up of their relationship was extremely well done. I was glued to this book.\n\nSo… here is why this wasn’t a five star read for me. I live for a deep, intense, emotional sex scene. By the time, they actually have sex, (75%ish), I was kind of over their sexcapades. A big plot point of this book is that Pippa was never able to have an “O” with her her ex. So for a big portion of this book, Jaime is focused on giving her an “O” by every means he can think of. Pages and pages of it and it just got kind of old and almost cringey. When they finally had sex, the build up was dead because I was totally over it.\n\nThat all being said, Jaime was amazing to her. I LOVED their relationship. I loved the way he encouraged her with her music and how moved he was by her when she sang. Aside from the cringey sex scenes, I loved everything about this book.",

But now, this chief of police is recovering from being shot and his Southern charm has been overshadowed by panic attacks and nightmares. He feels like a broody shell of the man he once was. Nash isn’t about to let anyone in his life know he’s struggling. But his new next-door neighbor, smart and sexy Lina, sees his shadows. As a rule, she’s not a fan of physical contact unless she initiates it, but for some reason Nash’s touch is different. He feels it too.

Besides, she doesn’t do relationships. Ever. A hot, short-term fling with a local cop? Absolutely. Sign her up. A relationship with a man who expects her to plant roots? No freaking way.

        "comment": "... In The Series! The Characters & Their Trendy Norther Virginia Town Come To Life In Vivid Detail & Spectacular Dialogue. The Magic Of Knox & Naomi Is Lacking, But It Picks Up Midway Through. Don’t Forget To Download The Free Bonus Epilogue Via The Link At The Back Of The Book!\n\nABOUT THE KNOCKEMOUT SERIES:\n\nThis is book two of the Knockemout series. To date, the series includes:\n1. Things We Never Got Over (Knox Morgan & Naomi Witt’s story)\n2. Things We Hide from the Light (Nash Morgan & Lina Solavita’s story)\n3. Things We Left Behind (Lucian Rollins & Sloane Walton’s story)\n\nNamed after a fictional small town in Northern Virginia, the series is full of lively characters, outrageous banter, and lots of steamy chemistry. There are adorable pets and kids that steal your heart. There is also a dose of danger brewing in the background. Geographically, it likely matches up with either real-life Western Loudoun or Clarke County, Virginia. Although the town is vibrant and attracts visitors from nearby Washington, D.C., Knockemout retains its sense of history and a strong feeling of community. It is rumored that the town was named to reflect the way its citizens have long worked out their problems – the good old-fashioned way. They fight it out and move on. The town is like a big extended family, with troublemakers, problem-solvers, and a charitable spirit.\n\nFROM THINGS WE NEVER GOT OVER, BOOK 1:\n\nThe story opens in August.\n\nNaomi Witt, thirty-six, is the quintessential good girl. A natural caretaker, she never wants to be a burden to others and always puts herself last. She hadn’t anticipated the last-minute road trip to Virginia that brought her to Knockemout. She was supposed to be on her honeymoon with Warner. She is a planner, so the change in plans put her way out of her comfort zone. She has a five-year plan and relies upon a plethora of lists to keep her life on track. She bought a home on Long Island worthy of raising a family and had worked in HR for Warner’s family’s investment firm for five years. Their four years together as a couple and two years planning the perfect wedding had all been for nothing, though. She tried to be everything to Warner, but she lost herself in the process. She realized her mistake at the last minute, and an unexpected phone call gave her the motivation she needed.\n\nFaced with a crisis of her own, Naomi nevertheless dropped everything when she received her estranged twin sister’s call for help. The timing gave her a place to secretly run away to as well as a distraction. Always the people pleaser, Naomi likes to fix problems. Her sister Tina has always been trouble, but Naomi never anticipated what was waiting for her in Virginia. In the year Tina had lived in Knockemout, she had managed to build herself quite a reputation, and as an identical twin, Naomi soon finds herself reaping the results. She doesn’t find many friendly faces.\n\nNaomi doesn’t find her sister, but she does end up as Tina’s latest victim. After having lived through the worst day of her life, the next day isn’t looking much better. Stuck without a phone, car, or credit card, she is dependent upon the kindness of others. Yet nothing could have prepared her for the discovery that Tina had left behind an eleven-year-old daughter – a niece Naomi never knew existed. Doing right by her is never a question. Waylay is tough like her mother, but behind the hard exterior might just be a pre-teen desperate for some normalcy. She is whip-smart but guarded, and Naomi knows that earning Waylay’s trust will be a huge challenge.\n\nNaomi is stuck in Knockemout for at least six months while the custodial arrangement works its way through the legal system. Her entire world pivots as her sense of control is challenged. All of her plans for the future are in upheaval, leaving her adrift with uncertainty. As the locals begin to know Naomi as Not Tina, she begins to settle in. However, there is one particular grumpy Viking of a man that drives her crazy and sets her body on fire at the same time. He is rude and infuriating, and his bad-boy vibe is completely the opposite of Warner’s. Almost from the time she rode into town, this man has put himself in the middle of her business, but the last thing she needs with Waylay's custody in limbo is trouble.\n\nKnox Morgan, forty-three, is his own man. His good looks, beard, and tattoos give him the quintessential bad-boy vibe, so women love him in spite of his prickly personality. He does what he wants, when he wants, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Rules are for people like his brother Nash, Knockemout’s Chief of Police. They have a long history of fighting, but they always made up, too. That changed about three years ago, and things haven’t been the same between them since. It breaks their grandmother’s heart. She raised the boys after their mother died, and now what's left of their family is in shambles.\n\nKnox knows good things never last, so anything more than a casual relationship has never been on the table for him. He doesn’t like strings, and he moves on at the first sign of an attachment. He hasn’t been with a local girl since high school, to the disappointment of many. When he is in the mood for a good chase, he heads out of town for a night or two of fun and pleasure. The routine has grown tiresome, though, which might explain his irresistible attraction to a certain newcomer. Little Miss Daisies in Her Hair is not his type at all. She is uppity and needy, and her vocabulary is too big. He hates that he wants her so badly, but if he cannot have her, nobody can – his brother Nash in particular.\n\nKnox came into money a few years back, but he didn’t take it for granted. He has carefully managed his growing portfolio of local businesses, increasing his net worth. He co-owns Whiskey Clipper with his long-time good friend Jeremiah, whose vision has paid off big time. The old barber shop was transformed into a salon that now draws clientele from D.C. A proud barber, people go out of their way to sit in Knox’s chair. He spends most of his time doing managerial work for his various businesses, though. When his business manager, Sherry Fiasco, hires Naomi behind his back, he realizes that he is in deep trouble. The last thing he needs every day is to see Naomi waitressing at Honky Tonk, his bar.\n\nKnox and Naomi have instant chemistry, but things get off to bad start when he confuses her with her delinquent sister. Naomi doesn’t appreciate being yelled at, and she is tired of always playing nice. Despite his intimidating presence, she pushes back, catching Knox and everyone around him off guard. Their crazy banter soon becomes entertainment for the locals. Denying their attraction to one another eventually proves to be harder than giving in to temptation. Knox is stubbornly stuck in his ways, and Naomi is just trying to get by. They agree that whatever they have is a temporary tryst, but then things get complicated. Neither is ready for a relationship. Things move quickly in their rocky ride, but they eventually earn their happy ending.\n\nIN THIS BOOK:\n\nThis book picks up where book one ends, and although it follows a new couple, it includes the same sense of community as well as a familiar cast of characters. It has been about seven weeks since Naomi first came to Knockemout. She is now scheduled to walk down the aisle and marry Knox in just three weeks’ time. It is two weeks in advance of the library’s annual Book or Treat event - a local Halloween celebration - putting this sometime in early to mid-October.\n\nAngelina Solavita, thirty-seven, doesn’t do relationships. Friends are too much trouble, too. She is definitely not a hugger. She is strong and independent, and she wouldn’t have it any other way. She enjoys five-mile runs and takeout. She also has an eye for fashion, plenty of makeup, and a closet filled with shoes. She loves fast cars, excitement, and the thrill of an adrenaline rush. Working for Pritzger Insurance has her on the road a lot, but she has nothing to tie her down. Sure the motels get old, but the occasional fling keeps things interesting.\n\nLina’s parents call daily, obsessing and smothering her, but thank goodness they don’t know all her secrets or they’d lose their minds. She doesn’t actually run corporate training as she led them to believe. Instead, she leads insurance investigations. While the law investigates stolen property, Investigator Solavita conducts her own independent investigations on the sidelines, looking for insured property that has gone missing. Her work occasionally becomes dangerous, and she frequently crosses paths with the law. It makes her heart race, but she likes the reminder. She doesn’t take her heartbeat for granted anymore, and after her last job went down, she doesn’t like thinking about how much her mistakes could cost others.\n\nIn Lina’s line of business, risk is rewarded. An opening in the High Net Assets department promises bigger risks and bigger rewards, and it has long been Lina’s dream job. She has just taken a quieter assignment in Northern Virginia and hopes to clear her head, get herself psyched up before thinking about that new job or heading back into the danger zone. She reasons she can swing by Knockemout and visit her long-time friend Knox Morgan while she is at it, but she never anticipates what awaits her in the quiet community.\n\nChief Nash Morgan, forty-one, has long planned to settle down. Based on the local fan girls, he wouldn’t have any trouble if he set his mind to it. But first things first, he wants to make Knockemout a better place to live by cleaning up the police department. He saw firsthand how injustice can affect the lives of those around him, and he took it upon himself to make things better by serving his community. That hasn’t sat well with his older brother Knox, who sometimes dabbles in the grey area of the law. They, along with their childhood best friend Lucian, got in a lot of trouble growing up, so Knox and Lucian don’t understand the law-abiding tendencies Nash suddenly acquired.\n\nBut a lot went wrong when Nash took two bullets on the side of the road just over a month ago. He has two scars to remind him of that night, but no memory of the event. Dashcam footage shows a shadowy man in a hoodie, but not enough to identify a suspect. Nash devoted his life to helping people and saving lives, but he couldn’t even defend himself. It was luck that saved his life when a local drove by and scared off his shooter, preventing a third and fatal shot. Now Nash dons his uniform and goes through the motions, but only to keep the rumors at bay. He is a shadow of the man he once was. He is empty. He is numb except for the lingering pain of his wounds. He feels nothing – until Lina enters his life. His brother’s friend isn’t the type to settle down; she is the type to break hearts. She is wrong for him, but he is willing to suffer the consequences if only he can spend some time near her and feel alive again.\n\nLina feels something new and profound when she is near Nash, but she tries to tamp it down. She doesn’t do relationships, and she is only passing through town. Her case keeps dragging on, though, so she ends up hanging around longer than she would like. As the locals welcome her into their kooky town, she finds herself making friends, much to her surprise. Knox’s wife Naomi adopts her into her friend group, and before she knows it her life is entwined with Nash’s. He is unavoidable. They battle their feelings for one another, but they give in knowing what they have is only temporary. They both face emotional journeys as they try to work things out, but danger lurks in the background, threatening to tear them apart. The couple eventually earns a happy ending.\n\nDon’t forget to download the free bonus epilogue via the link at the back of the book! It takes place a few years down the road – prior to the bonus epilogue for Knox and Naomi’s story.\n\nBook three, Things We Left Behind, also gets a brief preview in book one as Lucian and Sloane’s backstory is hinted at. This book offers more peeks into their turbulent past and glimpses of their antagonistic present.\n\nNash and Lina’s story takes readers back to Knockemout, Virginia. It has the same flavor of whacky characters and crazy banter as the first book in the series. The friendships have more depth here. Nash, Knox, and Lucian are tight, but federal agent Nolan is added to the group as well. It remains to be seen if he is a permanent addition, or even if he gets his own second chance romance in a separate book. Jeremiah and Stef sometimes hang out with the guys, too. Naomi and Sloane were fast friends, and Lina is welcomed into the mix with open arms. Stef sometimes hangs out with the girls, too. There is a lot of comic relief when the gang gets together, making for some memorable scenes. That said, I had a hard time buying into Nash and Lina’s story, unlike Knox and Naomi’s. The first half was much harder to get through. Toward the end, it picked up, but maybe just because I wanted to finally finish. I cannot explain why I couldn’t connect with them, but the magic of Knox and Naomi was just not there. I have been quite intrigued by Lucian, so I still look forward to reading more in this series.\n\nA few issues merit mention. First, there are a few minor timelines issues. Most of it adds up, but it is occasionally confusing. Second, in book one, Knox’s apartments are described as killer. Here they need updating. Finally, in book one, Knox dated Lina for four weeks when she was a college junior. Hence she would have been about twenty or twenty-one at the time, and Knox was twenty-four. That gives them a three or four-year age gap, not the six years depicted here. Additionally, Lina’s nearly two-decade friendship with Knox post-breakup didn’t feel credible to me. I would have expected her to lose interest at some point and stop making the effort. That was from book one, but here we even learn that she doesn’t have friends, making her efforts to keep up with Knox even more unbelievable. I suspect this might be the reason for my difficulty in getting behind her story. Further, the fact that she never met Nash in almost twenty years of friendship is not at all credible. Nash and Knox have a history of fighting, but it is only the last three years that they’ve not been able to make up. That Lina walks into Knox’s establishment like it is nothing suggests Knox has actually hung out with Lina in his hometown, despite what is said otherwise. It is too weird otherwise. And in a town that thrives on gossip, that friendship would have been rumored to be more and it would have gotten back to Nash, who would have made it his business to meet her.\n\nNash and Lina’s story is another good addition to the Knockemout world. The characters and their trendy Northern Virginia town come to life in vivid detail and spectacular dialogue. There are countless witty excerpts scattered throughout. I also came across five teary scenes. The couple grows on you. The story is well written. It is a little slow in the beginning, but it does pick up. The plot is fairly simple. The characters are wonderfully defined. There is a large cast of colorful and unique characters. The story is told in first person. The POV alternates between Nash and Lina. I rate this book 4.5 stars.",

        "comment": "This was one of my highly anticipated releases in 2023, and I was not disappointed!\n\nWe head back to Knockemout for book 2, featuring Knox’s college girlfriend Lina and his brother, Nash. And let me just say, I did NOT expect to love this book as much as I did, and I did not expect to fall in love with Nash the way that I did, and I did not expect to love Knockemout more than I already did. So needless to say, this book was everything I needed it to be and more, and I can’t wait to return to Knockemout later this year for book 3!\n\nThis book opens just weeks after the end of Things We Never Got Over, where Nash is still trying to heal from his wounds… and Lina is still in town “visiting” her friend Knox while working “in insurance.” I love how Lucy Score weaves romance, drama, and quite a few twists throughout this series, while also bringing in some lighthearted humor.\n\n“Baby’s breath is stupid. Fight me.”\n\n“Until I got here and met Nashhole.”\n\n“What’s happening? Did the fat blob just punch Nash? Who are the other two blobs?”\n\nLike I mentioned, I ended up loving Nash and Lina, and I loved them together. Nash is having a hard time recovering from his gunshot wounds, being the natural protector that he is. He wants to keep everyone safe, and he’s doubting himself because he couldn’t even keep himself safe. He wears the weight of the world on his shoulders and wants to do the right thing for everyone, but especially for his family and his community.\n\nLina is fighting her own demons. Her own trauma erected walls around her life so that she remained firmly in control of things, but those walls ended up shutting out all the good relationships that could’ve blossomed, leaving Lina feeling lonely while clinging to her independence. It’s a struggle for her to let go of her control to let anyone in, let anyone touch her (both physically and emotionally), which becomes impossible when she moves next door to Nash.\n\n“I live alone and I like it. I hate sharing the remote. I like not having to consult with someone else before ordering dinner. I don’t want to have to move the seat of my car every time I drive. The idea of passing my decisions through an ‘us’ filter leaves me feeling vaguely nauseated. I love my parents but their constant need to check up on me drives me insane, and that problem could become yours if this goes anywhere. I like to splurge on clothes and shoes, and I’m unwilling to justify that. I get up early and I work a lot. I don’t want to have to change that to accommodate someone else.”\n\nNash waited a beat. “Okay then. The only TV I watch is the occasional football game. The remote can be yours the rest of the time. I don’t mind cooking, but if you tell me you want takeout burgers, I’ll get you takeout burgers. I promise to always move your seat back to the original position after I drive. I wouldn’t mind having some nosy parents worry about me for a change. I like the way you dress just fine so I’ve got no problems with your shopping habits. Long as you let me spoil you once in awhile. As for the schedule thing, I think you’re just reachin’ because, Angel, I’m a cop. Enough said. And when it comes to making decisions together, I need a say in your personal safety. I expect you to want a say in mine. Any decisions that affect us together, we make together.”\n\nNash won’t take no from Lina, but he’s the MOST respectful he can be about it (swoony for sure). I love how Nash wants to have the conversations and be on the same page so that there is no misunderstanding regarding their relationship. While he does do some of the dumb stuff men do, like push her away when he thinks he’s becoming dependent on their relationship, these two match each other step for step along the way.\n\n“For the record, this is you pushing me away and this is me sticking.”\n\nI love that they both found what they needed, and they both pushed back. The tension between them screamed off the page, and I love that even their physical relationship came secondary to that tension, the push-and-pull. While their physical relationship was SO GOOD, it was everything else that made me love this book!\n\n“Listen to me, baby. You freak out all you want. I’ll still be here when you’re done.”\n\nIt would be a disservice not to mention the town of Knockemout and the secondary characters in this story. One of my other favorite things about Lucy is that she creates a WORLD for each of her books, and that world just feels so full of love and hope and gratitude and friendship that you can’t help but want the same thing in your own life. That’s true within the pages of Things We Hide From the Light as well. The Knockemout PD (and how Piper wandered around the bullpen to get treats) and the U.S. Marshal inserting himself into the community and how residents show up for businesses like the cafe and Honky Tonk and the gym and the library and everyone who showed up to the school for career day and the various community events like the library… it truly adds up to something special that makes you just love these people even more. Not to mention that ALL THE LOVE is on display in these pages… makes the world seem like a more hopeful place than it can be IRL, and I’m not complaining at all.\n\n“Friends make friends better.”\n\nRating: 5 big, fat, heart-eyed stars from me",

        "comment": "I put this before most next in series book reviews, but please expect some spoilers for the first book because you have no business being if you haven’t read that one\n\nKintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum\nMore on this later.\n\nDid I say Haunting Adeline was dark? I’m sorry forget everything I said because Haunting was almost a romcom compared with Hunting. Okay lies, don’t forget everything I said. Sure Haunting was dark, but Hunting was black onyx to Haunting’s dark grey. (There’s gotta be a better way to abbreviate these books). Hunting Adeline is the kind of dark that makes you question everything about humanity, it makes your black little soul shrivel into itself until only a Zade can bring you back. Consequently my obsession was that much worse. Yes it was harrowing, but it’s also the kind of romance that evokes every feeling in you, that convinces you that soulmates do exist. Or at least makes you hope they do.\n\nI’m telling you now, the triggers in this book are nasty; if you were triggered in book 1, this one is absolutely going to be worse. You’ve been warned. Especially considering how book 1 ended. But the way the author deals with Addie’s trauma and then her journey feels deeply cathartic, even though that journey is not at all mine. You know how sometimes it feels like an author poured their soul out into a story, that’s exactly what I felt here, like she cut open a vein and let her soul bleed out until it was all on the page. Painful, messy, heartbreaking, and eventually, healing. Yet still she brought a lightness to it no matter how bleak things got, less funnier than Haunting but with enough humor to remind you that the only way to survive this life is with laughter.\n\nI was desperately consumed by Addie’s journey from a sassy, impulsive, confident girl to a broken shell back to a tough bad-a-s-s with a thirst for vengeance and a reshaped moral compass. A work in progress but stronger than ever. This is where the kintsugi comes in. I felt every emotion with her, and before I knew it I was sobbing through her healing journey at 3 am. And eventually cheering for her for every bit of vengeance and justice she got for herself.\n\nI’d go so far as to say she saves herself to a large extent, but you know a lot of it is not possible without Zade. And it goes both ways, they’re so entwined there’s no one without the other. We already know Zade is like Joe mixed with Dexter on steroids, but his heart is a curious thing. Black and a little charred, but it beats and bleeds red. He’s a God among mortals, but he isn’t devoid of emotion. In fact, he’s deeply in touch with his emotions, which is rare for romance heroes, let alone villainous ones. And he’s brainy and funny and so tall. Omg I sound like a teenager with a crush but omg can you blame me??? He does heinous things, makes absolutely no apologies about them, yet has his own unshakeable code he lives by. Nothing is off limits when it comes to Addie of course. And we really see that in action this time around. His sheer madness in finding her and keeping her safe is awe inspiring. He has that villain who will burn down the world to save you energy that we love. Or I love at least. I never hated Zade even at his worst in Haunting (judge me all you want, I am who I am), but Hunting is where I fell irrevocably in love with him. I am forevermore at his mercy.\n\nHis techniques might be interesting to say the least, but whether he’s wooing her or protecting her or helping her heal, my heart was just a useless melty puddle with every single thing Zade does for Addie. I mean the adorability of Zade’s voice in Addie’s head, calming her and guiding her at her worst, and vice versa? My poor heart can only handle so much. Their connection is more electric, bl👀dier, and more painful than ever, and a million degrees hotter. They were a five alarm fire in Haunting, but now their chemistry has layers; pain wrapped in heat wrapped in poison wrapped in deranged and irrational and pure love.\n\nI could probably write an essay on Zade’s psyche alone, but I haven’t slept all night inhaling the last half of the book, and I’m already rambling, so I’ll refrain. An unexpected delight of this book was Sibby (yes, her) and her relationship with Zade and Addie. Her illness is normalized and their acceptance of her is absolute. And I’m frothing for her duet after all the development we’ve seen so far. Jay and Daya and Zaddie’s mrdry little family have my heart. I loved Haunting but this felt like a richer, if more shattering experience, and my insides feel rearranged from it. Also I never thought I’d say this, but Zaddie’s love is a love like no other, and I’d carve a rose into my heart for Zaddy any day. Well that’s the end of Nikita’s unfiltered love declarations for the day. Maybe.",

        "comment": "(Mild) SPOILERS.\n\nI admit to bring a fan of HDC’s work. Do I feel kids should be reading this- wizards no. Eighteen and over, sure; even though honestly I feel people over 30 are going to better handle the gruesome reality in here.\n\nHaunting was ok for me. It read as expected. But Hunting hurt. I’m not a huge Zade fan as if he weren’t a billionaire with god tier self defense skills, he’d just be a confused man with split intentions (let me stalk this woman and also kill stalker like men…). But why I liked Hunting is the crippling imagery HDC starts to touch on in the grooming and breaking of a successful “won’t happen to me,” woman. A phenomenal but ugly horror story could dive deeper into the psychology of breaking innocence the way Hunting starts to touch on. But my sick need for a HEA was satisfied when the antagonist gets their bloody comeuppance and the groomed survivor finds herself in the new skin of a reborn woman through her trauma. So the fact even here there’s a HEA, does kindof work for me. Like the most damage can survive and become something new, living a good life.\nDo I want HDC to be successful- yes. Do I feel more needs to be done to discuss the topics booming in contemporary romance with young minds? Yeah, I kindof do. Regardless of gender everyone needs to remember a book is a version of fantasy. When you crave a more violent or dubious consent standard in a relationship as a young adult where a mature conversation on limits has not occurred in reality? Damage will occur. But hey- if this opens up a conversation avenue on consent, great.\nKeep killing it HDC.\nHappy reading.",

        "comment": "After reading the prequel, Satan's Affair, which I loved, I had a very hard time finishing this duet. During Haunting A. I wasn't a fan of Adeline's character, the way I saw her was like a contradiction of what the author was trying to portray through her. Also, another things that discouraged me while reading book one was the lack of the build up of their connection. The majority of the time it was Addie trying to puff her chest like she was brave and confronting Zade through a phone. That's why it was so hard for me to assimilate the fact that she was developing feelings for Zade. However, even though in this book they came together around the half of the book, I loved the connection they shared. I think Addie's situation and traume was what finally brought them to face each other in a more intimate way and not only the sexual tension they battled with all the time during book one. My favorite scene in general is definitely when she pulled out the gun on him in. I loved how they finally crumbled and bled together showing their vulnerabilities to each other. All pretenses, sas, sexual desire, all was gone in that moment. Only pure honesty and emotions were present. I loved that the author included Sibby to this story. I remember loving her novella so so much. I can't wait to read more about our little demon slayer. Even though I had a hard time finishing this duet, I would say that overall if you're a dark romance lover, it is worth it, I would definitely recommend it but please make sure you're ok with the TW. Remember, dark romance is not for everyone so if you're not into it, just don't read it. Enjoy!!!",

        "comment": "My title pretty much sums up the plot and the characters in this book. It’s billed as a romantic suspense, but seriously there is no romance. Yes, there is passion, but romance is not present. There is no Prince Charming in the book and even Christian Grey looks tame and well adjusted compared to the men in this story. The book is filled with damaged people, the scions of the ultra rich. There are no morally grey characters in this tale of a secret society in an elite private college in Pennsylvania. I don’t think I have read a darker book, and I’ve read a lot of books. This book is pitch black, and filled with lots of dominant sex, filled with violence and humiliation toward the female partner. Why does it get four stars, because even though a personally didn’t care for parts of the book, the author wrote a book that clicks all the dark romance boxes. The male protagonist has been bred to be the way he is and the female protagonist has been groomed to be the perfect doll for the male to toy with. For three years the secret society makes the males members abstain from inter-coarse, only allowing self pleasures. Senior year they are handed a chosen, a female vowed to service them. I guess abstinence makes sexual sadist out of the Uber wealthy, and attracts woman who jump head first into pleasing them. Parents sacrificing their children on the alter of power. The book is pretty much Lord of the Flies college edition.\n\nI am reviewing the book in the genre classification, as I’m not going to shame readers who flock to this category. But in one crucial scene the female protagonist Blakely, doesn’t lock a door after running through it, thinking her life is in danger, and she is about to be killed. So she is caught. Hmmm…. Poor girl even gives the cliché of dumb blond a run for their money. No offense to blonds as I was born one. In fact she is referred to as a Barbie, it seems all the woman in this book fit that characterization, willing to be manipulated by the men in the book, as they have all been breed to subservient to the patriarchal society of the Lords. This isn’t kink shaming it is character shaming as it was the dumbest move Blakely could make.\n\nMy view of the book popularity and the genre as a whole is that readers want the complete and utter fantasy as they sit safely behind their kindles. These are the bodice rippers of the 21st century. It takes a lot to shock and titillate readers and by the popularity of this book the author has found her audience.\n\nPlease for the love of all that is holy read the trigger warnings.",

        "comment": "This was my first book by Shantel Tessier and after reading The Ritual I am hooked! This book got a lot of hype online and I was skeptical if it would live up to it. Now that I’ve finished The Ritual, I can confirm, this book exceeded every expectation I had.\n\nIn the beginning of the book you are immediately told what The Lords are and I loved going through each year with Ryat. It felt like I was completely immersed into this world, without the history being boring. I fell for Ryat and Blakely instantly needing to know how it ends.\n\nI loved the dual POV and getting to feel what each character thinking/feeling. I also loved the supporting characters and appreciate the attention to detail around those relationships! Sarah was absolutely hilarious and I loved her and Blakely’s friendship!\n\nIt’s rare that I can read and then re-read a book multiple times without getting bored the 2nd time around. I have read this book 3 times and would read it again in a heartbeat!",

I really enjoyed learning about who.she is and what makes her tick\nIt was fantastic to see her discover it to and become proud of who she is, what she likes, and demand what she wants. I adore her. Of course I think she still wanders off alone too much for someone in such a dangerous situation, but the book has to have a way to build suspense.\nAll in all I highly recommend this book to those who love down and dirty, bad-boy gets the girl, and just a hint (or more 😉) of ghost pepper spice.",

        "comment": "A forced roommate situation? He's a loner but with nothing to hide, and she is a smiler with dark secrets. And, I am biased.\n\nLilian Monroe's books are must-reads for me. I generally enjoy her writing but am not blind to her flaws. She over-describes in detriment to creating the narrative and she can be repetitive in presenting character's internal monologues. This is actually less apparent in books where she works from first-person POVs, and the urgency of someone telling their own story overrides the potential boring aspects of data dumping. (The Big Bossy books are generally great. Also, the Dirty Midlife books. I have not read all the others yet.)\n\nIn the book at hand, she presents two delightful characters but too often mires them in ruts of now-this-happens-and -that-happens rather than connecting the action in such a way that it feels organic. Too much tell, not enough show. And, yet, when she wants to, Miss Monroe so knows how to show!\n\nI love Marlon and Camilla. The scene in which he ministers to her aching and bloody feet is lovely. We know right from the beginning these two have the hots for each other. It is mostly Camilla's fault that the relationship does not progress as it should. She keeps secrets that it seems ridiculous not to tell. Her determination to pay her debts is not praise-worthy but just stupid -- especially after she has paid her debt, and this guy comes back and asks for more. Perhaps there are people who do respond this way out of fear but I just almost stopped reading because this was so -- so -- stupid of her. And then she gets all snitty with Marlon. I did not think he deserved that.\n\nThere are some exciting twists and turns, and God help me, I was so exasperated with her at one point that I pretty much wanted her to land on her face. Perhaps end up in jail herself, and trying to explain how her insane stubbornness and failure to trust people who loved her, got her there.\n\nWell, they say one test of a good book is that it engages your emotions. This did, though I did not always like it. I can endorse it as an interesting and driving read. That is, you will be driven to read to the end. You may or may not like how it got there. But you will almost certainly like Marlon and perhaps even Camilla and be rooting for them. It's worth the money if you are not a KU-read-everything consumer.\n\nNow, why am I giving it 5 stars if I seem so critical? Why not 4 stars? I read a lot and, based on my experience, this book has way more to offer than the average book you trip over in KU.",

        "comment": "This is such an enjoyable novel. The three-dimensional characters, intriguing plot, easy-to-read narrative voice and touches of humor – everything works together to create a truly delightful read.\n\nI especially appreciated the depth of the main characters – Marlon and Camilla. Each had strengths that also could be considered weaknesses – Marlon’s “protectiveness” and Camilla’s “independence.” Ms. Monroe showed how both of these characters are essentially caretakers, and, both of them have tried to shed that role in different, but similar, manners. Camilla vowed to never depend on another person, wearing her independence as a badge of honor, even while “caretaking” by feeding people through her bakery. Marlon recognized the downside of his protective tendencies and shut himself off from the world, even while starting a security business that kept his clients safe. I loved these juxtapositions! The characters’ recognition of their personally damaging behavior, while at the same time, engaging in professions that perpetuated the protective/caretaker mindset!\n\nI also liked the intersection of Camilla’s “problem” and Marlon’s client – the same character, the novel’s main villain. This was a great plot point because it ramped my anticipation through the roof. Not only was I on the edge of my seat with the sexual tension between the two main characters, but I was also biting my nails wondering when Camilla’s secret \"problem\" would surface on Marlon's radar.\n\nThe mystery/suspense aspect of the novel was also expertly written. I gravitate toward novels that feature an engaging story intertwined with the romance. Ms. Monroe’s “Craving” did not disappoint me in this regard!\n\nThere was only one negative to the novel, in my mind. I really wanted to see some retribution for the way Camilla’s family treated her. I had been cheering on Camilla as she “picked herself up by her bootstraps” in her dealings with her family, so the resolution of her issues was a bit of a let-down to me. I guess I’m pretty vindictive!\n\nIn summary, “Craving” is one of Lilian Monroe’s best efforts, in my mind. I highly recommend it for fans of contemporary romance – and especially for those who also enjoy a good mystery/suspense plot woven throughout.",

I especially enjoy the way she writes her books in a series with a continuation of different characters from the previous book(s) in the series. Each book is a standalone story with the protagonists and most of the friends/family members from the series appearing in each book. So while it is better to start with the first book then work through the series in order, it is not necessary to do so.\nI recommend Lilian’s books.",

The Couple Has Excellent Chemistry Despite The Fact That They Spend So Much Time Fighting It. For A Free Bonus Episode, Don’t Forget To Sign Up For The Newsletter Via The Link At The Back Of The Book!\n\nABOUT THIS BOOK:\n\nThis book is a standalone in the Dark Prince Road world. It appears to be the first in a series that follows three lifelong friends from Potomac, Maryland. All live the bachelor lifestyle with no intention of settling down. Romeo, Ollie, and Zach grew up on the same road together, and they know one another’s deepest secrets. While Ollie and Zach headed off to Harvard for undergrad, Romeo attended MIT across town. They’re all back in the D.C. area again, still living on the same street but in their own houses now.\n\nRomeo Costa, Jr. has a heart as cold as ice. He succeeds through his brilliant mind and intimidation. His classic Italian good looks never fail to turn heads, and he speaks like he stepped out of a nineteenth-century English novel. Women don’t much interest him, but weapons and finance do. He lives alone in his quiet and spotless mansion and he prefers it that way.\n\nOliver von Bismarck looks like a human Ken doll and acts like a man-child. He loves women – the more, the merrier. He is loud and messy – and basically the exact opposite of his friend Romeo. He is unashamed and deliberately obnoxious, yet he maintains the power of natural charm. He develops an unhealthy fixation on Dallas’s younger sister Frankie, despite his friends’ criticisms.\n\nZachary Sun is brilliant, but he lacks in the emotional department. His good looks might make up for that, but his impossible standards prevent him from finding any woman worth his while. His doting mother actively tries to play matchmaker, but nothing sticks. Zach can hardly put up with his own friends at times, so the prospect of him settling down is dim. His passion is collecting art, something his friends don’t really understand.\n\nIN THIS BOOK:\n\nThe story opens in the summer – most likely late August for the timeline to work.\n\nRomeo Niccolo Costa, thirty-one, likes money, power, and war. He has no room for love, but he is happy to indulge in revenge. He is determined to take over for his father as the next CEO of Costa Industries. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, the company is a DOD contractor and a major player in the defense industry. As the CFO, he delivers, despite his father’s poor leadership. Romeo has his own ideas for the company that bears his name, but Bruce Edwards has spent decades buttering up to Senior Costa, and he currently holds the position of COO as well as Senior’s ear. The man has no shame. Romeo’s rocky relationship with his father doesn’t help matters, either, so Romeo’s prospects remain in question. As Senior’s health begins to take a hit, Romeo reluctantly makes plans to marry – his father’s requirement to be considered for the promotion. Senior wants to see his legacy live on, but Romeo has no intention of actually following through and having a family. He is a master of self-control, and there is zero risk of that happening.\n\nAn imposing figure with savage dark looks that reflect his Italian heritage, Romeo can have any woman in a room that he wants despite his undeniable lack of interest. His frozen heart is beyond the reach of any woman, no matter how alluring. He commands with his imposing presence, and he always gets his way. His lack of conscience ensures that fact since he isn’t above playing dirty. In spite of his methods, he has never been caught in a scandal. He allowed himself to be vulnerable once, but he won’t be repeating that mistake. He was twenty-one and had a year left before earning his engineering degree from MIT when he met Morgan. They were together five years – until Romeo finished his Harvard MBA – before that fell apart royally. In the five years since, he has devoted himself to earning the CEO title. Towards that end, he now must take a bride – and an opportunity presents itself that is much too good to be true.\n\nDallas Maryanne Townsend, twenty-one, is a good southern girl. Born to a wealthy family and raised in Chapel Falls, Georgia, she is well-bred and schooled in etiquette. She is close to earning her English Literature degree from Emory University, and if she decides to apply herself, she will soon graduate. But Dallas isn’t motivated by education. She is perfectly happy to spend her days with a book. She reads just about any genre, although romance is her favorite. She doesn’t aspire to have a career of her own; her biggest goal is to become a mother. She absolutely adores children and wants a brood of her own. Some might think little of that choice, but she doesn’t much care about the opinion of others. As for boys, she has kissed a few, but the good girl she is, she has been saving herself for marriage.\n\nMadison Licht has been a lifelong family friend, and Dallas’s marriage to him had been arranged by their fathers many years ago. She feels nothing for him, though they have had two dates as of late. He lives in Potomac, Maryland, so they occasionally talk on the phone. Madison is eight years older than Dallas, so she knows he must have a history with other women. They both seem willing to accept their fate and make the most of it, though. The idea belonged to the distant future, safe from her current concerns. That changed, however, two days ago when their engagement announcement ended up in the paper.\n\nThe annual Chapel Falls Debutant Ball isn’t Dallas’s idea of a good time, but when her two best friends mention the catering menu, she doesn’t hesitate to attend. Dallas loves food – almost any food will do. She eats nonstop, which is hard to believe considering her lovely figure. She is messy and loud, despite her excellent upbringing. Although chaos always surrounds her, people seem to love her. There has been no shortage of offers for her hand, even though she is already spoken for.\n\nWhen Romeo and his friend Ollie show up unannounced at the Chapel Falls ball, nobody would have expected one of the notorious bachelors to actually be looking for a bride. But if Romeo must marry, the fiancée of Madison Licht will do just fine. Her beauty surprises him, and she stirs something deep inside him. Then there is the issue of her personality. Unlike every other woman in the room, she seems far more interested in the shortbread than in his attention. She talks too much and doesn’t seem to have any manners despite her good upbringing. Perhaps he can deal with her if they just don’t talk. After they marry, he can give her a credit card and send her on her way while he goes about business as usual. But first, he must break off her engagement.\n\nThe couple begins as a very unlikely pair, and their mismatch continues after their vows. Romeo has roped Dallas into marriage with him and is surprised when he feels a shred of guilt afterward. But that isn’t to say they can make things work, and Dallas’s laziness is a big issue. And she seems absolutely determined to spend as much money as she can in order to get his attention. His friends tease him about how he is changing, but it is all in their imagination. Romeo is beyond saving – that boat sailed years ago. The couple faces personal challenges as they learn how to live together, but there are outside forces at play as well. They eventually earn a happy ending.\n\nFor a free bonus episode, don’t forget to sign up for the newsletter via the link at the back of the book!\n\nWow! Romeo and Dallas’s swoony story is absolutely the best book I’ve read so far this year. The first half had me in stitches, thanks to the incredible banter. There are numerous quotable lines. It is sharp, smart, and snarky. The middle starts to drag a bit, but as the story turns more serious in tone, it picks up again. Thanks to the crazy characters, there are even a few laughs amidst the darkest moments of the story. Romeo is absolutely horrible. He is unfeeling and lacks empathy. He dictates orders and demands complete control. He does afford Dallas certain freedoms, though, in an effort to make the arrangement work. His heartbreaking story takes you by surprise when it is finally revealed, and suddenly his character unfolds. There is so much more to him and his story than meets the eye. Dallas seems determined to turn Romeo’s life upside down, however. The more he pushes her away, the worse she behaves. She never wanted to marry him, but she is suddenly bound to him for the foreseeable future. In response, she rebels. They both behave like children. Over time, however, they begin to see glimpses of one another that hint to more depth. Once the cracks in their walls begin to form, it is impossible to prevent them from eventually crumbling.\n\nThere are a few issues that merit mention. First and foremost, the cherry trees blossom briefly in the March/April timeframe in D.C. – not in the summer as depicted here. Second, I cannot picture the road in Potomac being a fifteen-minute drive or more, which is the time it takes for Romeo to get to both Zach’s and his parents’ homes (on the same street). Third, Dallas may be inexperienced, but I was surprised by her gullibility in the opening. Fourth, the original trip from Chapel Falls to the D.C. area doesn’t add up time-wise. There is no reason to believe they didn’t leave during the day or even in the evening, so the 5am arrival at Romeo’s home just doesn’t add up. It is also hard to swallow that she sleeps an entire twenty-four hours soon after. Fifth, Dallas once again sets herself up for scandal at her wedding, and you would think she learned her lesson by that time. Fortunately, nothing becomes of it other than her poor judgment. Sixth, locals typically abbreviate to just Tysons as opposed to Tyson’s Galleria. Seventh, Romeo supposedly has a good boy reputation, but that doesn’t easily reconcile with his quick temper, cold demeanor, and lack of empathy. He has remained scandal free, but his character leans on the dark side. Eighth, Dallas later contradicts herself when she claims that children are not her dream – she did use that word earlier. Finally, the timeline is sometimes vague and difficult to follow, but it does generally work if you time it beginning in very late August.\n\nRomeo and Dallas’s enemies-to-lovers romance will have you laughing out loud as you race to the end. There are thirty-two laugh-out-loud moments by my count and three teary scenes as well. The couple has excellent chemistry despite the fact they spend so much time fighting it. The characters are so unique and well-defined that this story will stick with you long afterward. As of now, this is a standalone, but it must certainly lead to a series. Romeo’s best friends Ollie and Zach require their own stories, too. This story is wonderfully written. The plot is somewhat complex. The characters are real and three-dimensional. They are complicated and layered. The story is told in first person. The POV alternates between Romeo and Dallas. I rate this book five stars.",

        "comment": "4⭐️/ 4🌶️\n\nHigh society, the fabulously rich and wealthy, parties, and well known people of high status was the type of world Dallas Townsend was accustomed to. Growing up, she had the means to buy anything and everything she wanted. With an engagement set up by her father to his friend’s son, Dallas’s future was already set in place, and in the meantime she would just live her privileged life as usual, until at one debutante ball, Dallas came face to face with the stoic yet handsome, Romeo Costa. This story had a “Beauty and The Beast” inspired vibe, a very serious/morally gray male lead, who most definitely wasn’t like any Romeo that you might’ve imagined, a forced engagement, business rivals mixed in, revenge, and of course romance, and spice. Dallas Townsend didn’t expect to be engaged to Romeo Costa, but with Romeo’s cunning and manipulative ways, everything went according to his plan.\n\nRight away, can we please appreciate the sheer beauty that is this book cover! Honestly, I just love staring at it, it’s so beautiful yet also fits the aesthetic and vibe of the story!\n\nThis story just screamed filthy rich and I kinda loved that! Something about the way the world that Dallas lived in to casually mentioning the kind of money she had to what she wore, which was most definitely not the affordable clothes I’m use to, but was wishing I could have from all the designer clothes she wore throughout the story. Dallas grew up in a wealthy family and had been surrounded by other wealthy people all her life in Chapel Falls. With Dallas being set to marry her father’s friend son, Madison, it seemed like Dallas’s future was set into place, but when Romeo came into the picture not only did he make an entrance, but he essentially ruined Dallas’s life in the mere hours of meeting one another at the debutante ball.\n\nDallas wasn’t the kind of woman who wanted to thrive and succeed in a career. If anything, Dallas was a rich girl who spent her days shopping, not trying hard in her classes, and gilding by in life. Writing that down, it makes it seem like Dallas is the kind of character you wouldn’t like, but I actually liked the quirky side to her. Dallas wasn’t the strongest of characters I’ve read before, but I did like some aspects to her such as, her love of sweets, fashion, and being honest in what she truly wanted in her future.\n\nIf you thought a man by the name of Romeo was going to be all romantic and the gentlemen like the one in Shakespeare’s story, then you’d be wrong to believe that was how Romeo Costa was. Romeo Costa was a morally gray man with cunning, deceptive behavior in order to get what he wanted, even if that meant orchestrating a set up in which he and the innocent fiancé of his rival were caught together in an unflattering manner then he was all for it. With Romeo focused on exacting revenge of his rival, trying to attain his CEO position at his father’s company, the last thing that Romeo wanted to deal with was Dallas Townsend.\n\nDallas and Romeo were the complete opposites of one another. Dallas was more carefree, and quirky, whereas Romeo was stoic and serious. The dynamic between Dallas and Romeo from the beginning was very much enemies to lovers especially with the way the two would get on each other’s nerves or retaliating against each other. Even though there were moments in which things got hot and heavy between Romeo and Dallas, there was still some form of hate brewing or more like strongly dislike. If you’re looking for an enemies to lovers story, this book definitely covers that front and more with the tension, back and forth mini battles, and trying to one up each other.\n\nRomeo wasn’t the sweetest and most angelic of people, but boy did he know how to entice and command Dallas when it came to sexy time! Romeo was rough, hard, and all kinds of alpha in every way in and out of the bedroom. Before Dallas got with Romeo, she grew up in a very religious community so, she was prevented from exploring her sexuality as it was expected for her (as well as the other ladies in her town) to remain virginal and pure before marriage. When Romeo came into the picture and subsequently Dallas found herself getting married to him, she sought the chance to explore all the pleasures that Romeo could offer her, and she took every chance possible. For that instance, I liked seeing Dallas going after what she wanted with Romeo and taking control in her sexuality and straying away from the, “pure, innocent, virgin” that was expected of her all her life before marriage. The spice in this book was hot, and at times I was having to do a double take at what I just read at what Romeo or Dallas said or did in certain spicy scenes like WHOA THAT WAS HOT! Romeo calling Dallas, “good girl”, and the DIRTY TALK! OMG! I love praise YUPPPP! And yeah there was plenty of spice in this book that was equally delicious and downright dirty in the best way possible.\n\nI actually really enjoyed this book a lot! Romeo and Dallas were all kinds of chaotic, but also somehow made sense together. At first glance, you would think that there wasn’t much to Dallas’s character, but as the story progressed, she grew on me and I liked seeing her obsession with books, eating different foods which she loved a lot, and slowly managing to get Romeo to open up to her. Romeo was by all means not the romantic Romeo we all had imagined, but with his alpha male ways and commanding presence, he exuded power in everything. There was plenty of spice and passion between Dallas and Romeo that made for some fun scenes to read, but their love story was uniquely theirs which I couldn’t get enough of. I loved seeing the, “Beauty and The Beast” inspired take in Dallas and Romeo’s story, and with each chapter I was more intrigued by them. I especially loved the story towards the end as Romeo became more open with Dallas and fully came to the realization that he was in love with her (Awwww!). This story had all kinds of fun for me to dive into with the rich people, luxury clothes, cars, lifestyle, Dallas being quirky yet coming into her own person and finding love with Romeo. The epilogue highlighted the happy ending in Dallas and Romeo’s story and I was happy how it ended!",

        "comment": "I honestly thought that it couldn’t get better than Sick Boys. What I read about Nathan and Kai in Sick Boys I did not like them at all and I mean at all.\nNow I have read Evil Boys and OMG…I have actually fallen in love (more with some than others).\nFirst off…Lana Rivera is amazing. As a little girl is the one who saved her brother, Felix, from his mother (CSA) and that is most amazing!!! As an young adult growing up in that world, she chooses to take out her violent urges on the same kind of people like her mother and only them. I applaud her because she is protecting children!!! She is a bad-you-know-what and I love that about her character. She is definitely not weak and actually saves the guys a couple of times…go Lana!\nNow on to the guys…Took me a hot minute to like Nathan (all the way up to his sister actually) then I find he is a big cupcake and I loved that about him. When Lana helps save her then he just worships her and I liked him.\nKai I began to like fairly early on because he was obsessively in love with her the whole book. Would do anything to make her love him, to protect her, just want to live and die for her. So I fell for him.\nMilo…wow. I think he was my favorite with Lana. He worshipped her like a queen and goddess. She did no wrong and he was in love with her. He wanted to tell her how much he worshipped her everyday and that she could do whatever she wanted to him and he would do whatever she wanted for her own pleasure. It just made him happy…genuinely happy.\nThink I like this book almost a little more than Sick Boys and I really like that one.\nThe bedroom scene at the end is quite steamy!!!

I mean book one was spicy, but this one was beyond steamy and spicy, and leaves you needing a cold shower to cool off!\nI don’t even know where to begin, but I absolutely loved Milo and his humor. That boy was so sweet, and his kinky personality… yeah. I loved how he bowed down to his “Queen”. I enjoyed all the guys, Nathan and his controlling and obsessive nature, and Kai was so possessive. But when Nathan and Milo got together it left me drooling and wanting more! And oh where to start with Lana. She was the fierce, tough, independent heroine I love in these dark bully romances. She took crap from no one, stood up to her brother, and wasn’t afraid face danger head on for the innocent. There was second where she got on my nerves, but it didn’t last long.\nClarissa honestly couldn’t have written this book any better. It was packed with spice, had the action and suspense, and was very twisted. I can’t wait for book 3- Vile Boys! I’m anxious to see what happens with Crystal, and look forward to her having her own little harem with Caleb, Blaine and Ares.",

But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself.\n\nThe only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them.\n\nThe two form a connection despite the pressure surrounding them, but as their romance grows, so does the risk. Kenna must find a way to absolve the mistakes of her past in order to build a future out of hope and healing.",

Whoever was the first person to say they fell in love must have already fallen out of it. Otherwise, they’d have called it something much better.\"\"\n\nIn this book, we are taken on an emotional journey of redemption + hope. Kenna Rowan, a mentally + emotionally troubled (see: TRAUMATIZED) young mother seeking a little hope (not so much \"a second chance\" to start with) after serving prison time for a tragic mistake, returns to her hometown with the desire to reconnect with her daughter. However, rebuilding bridges proves to be a daunting task as everyone seems determined to shut her out. Like everyone from her old life are literal WALLS in her way/protecting around her daughter. The only beacon of light in Kenna's life is Ledger... daughter's fathers best friend... and a link to her daughter, who ends up standing by her side despite the risks involved.\n\nAs a mother myself, I couldn't help but be deeply moved by the heartbreak and struggles Kenna faces. The lack of communication and misunderstandings portrayed in the story, while sometimes frustrating, added a relatable touch of realism.\n\nThe scene on the curb across the street was gut-wrenching and beautifully written, leaving me STILL thinking about it months later. Ledger's fierce protection of Kenna's daughter won me over, and his dedication, spoke volumes about his character.\n\nThe title is a perfect fit to this storyline, truly capturing the essence of how we find pieces of lost loved ones in our everyday lives. The subtle nods to \"HIM\" are skillfully woven into the narrative, adding depth without becoming overwhelming.\n\nIn the end, C.Hoover delivers another captivating tale of a mother's love, self healing + finding hope amid the darkest moments. \"Reminders of Him\" is a powerful and emotionally charged story that will leave readers with a renewed appreciation for the strength of the human spirit.",

        "comment": "Some personal background first. In 2010 my cousin, who was 21, was involved in a car accident. I don't remember all the intricate details, but he got into a verbal altercation with another person in a parking lot that moved to the road. The two drivers (one being my cousin) we're racing where the other vehicle was driving in the oncoming lane and ended up clipping my cousin's vehicle. The other vehicle wrecked and three occupants died. My cousin left the scene, drove back by, didn't stop and also didn't call 911. He was sentenced to 99 years for three counts of murder and 10 years for leaving the scene of an accident with injuries to be served consecutively after his 99 year sentence. The judge assumed that he had no remorse due to his stoic appearance in court. He is still serving his first sentence in a state prison. He had a three year old daughter and a wife when he was sentenced. He is now divorced, and his ex-wife and daughter have moved to Virginia. I don't know when the last time he's seen his daughter. I have only met her once.\n\nI started reading Colleen Hoover in 2012 when Slammed was available for review on NetGalley. I loved it. And she became an auto-buy author for me. After 20+ books, I feel like I know her writing style to the point where she surprises me less and less even with her books such as Verity and Layla. As a matter of fact, her most recently published books have been my least favorite she's written... until Reminders of Him. This book reminded me of old Colleen Hoover.\n\nKenna was involved in a car accident with her boyfriend. She was driving. She was under the influence. She thought he was dead. She couldn't find a cell phone, and so she left the scene of the accident. I won't get into more than that with the details because that's part of the story. But she was barely pregnant and subsequently gave birth while incarcerated. Her daughter was taken from her care and placed in the custody of her boyfriend's parents. She has now, 4 years later, been released and hopes to reestablish her connection with her daughter.\n\nLedger was Scottie, Kenna's boyfriend's, best friend. He wasn't around much when Kenna and Scottie started dating so he'd never met the girl who murdered his best friend. Ledger has spent the last 5 years creating a version of Kenna in his head. Only when he finally meets her in person, not knowing who she is, he slowly comes to find out that she isn't anything he imagined her to be.\n\nThe pain in this book was palpable. Every single character is deeply filled with pain. Kenna lost the love of her life and her daughter in and because of one terrible moment and decision. Scottie's parents are so filled with grief that they can't see past their own pain to anyone else's. Ledger is hurting too. He misses his friend, he loves Scottie's parents like his own, he wants to protect Diem (Scottie and Kenna's daughter), and he's falling for the one person he never could have imagined.\n\nFavorite quotes:\n-She's quiet, but she's said just enough to make me want the rest of her words.\n\n-It's incredible how two people who have never met can have so many of the same mannerisms.\n\n-It proves that time, distance, and devastation allow people enough opportunity to craft villains out of people they don't even know.\n\nI only had two complaints that I can remember right now. Roman is a side character who happens to have a crush on a married woman. He isn't actively pursuing her. Like he's not asking her out or anything. But he does regularly show up at her bakery to buy cupcakes from her. He's wishing for her marriage to fail. I think this sucks. Obviously these people exist. Not all people, married and unmarried, respect the commitment two people make to each other. But sheesh, I think enough marriages fail on their own without outsiders wishing, hoping, and waiting for their opportunity to swoop in and snatch one party up. I just wish this wasn't included even though it was such a small part of the overall story.\n\nMy second complaint is, yet again, Colleen Hoover uses letters as a major plot component. At first I wondered if she was doing this out of like a writing shortcut. You know how a villain will spell out all of their evil plans to the hero of a movie in one big speech. Well, in several of her books I've felt like she uses letters as big information drops. And she does that again in Reminders of Him. I can't say CoHo is reading my reviews of her books, but I honestly felt like she was almost using the letters in Reminders of Him to spite me. That's very conceited of me, I realize. So what I think is the more likely option is that she's doing it on purpose. Maybe this is becoming a calling card of hers or something. Like she's seeking out opportunities to include letters in her books rather than using them as a crutch to dump information. I would still like to see her write a book that doesn't include a letter like these, but we'll see.\n\nReminders of Him was my favorite Colleen Hoover release in the last several years. This blows Verity and Layla and especially Regretting You out of the water. I used to feel a little apathetic towards her books due to repetition and the big reveal being more important than the journey, but Reminders of Him renewed my Colleen Hoover enthusiasm. The similarities and differences to my own cousin's life and accident made this all the more relatable to me. Reminders of Him gets 5 Stars. Have you read Reminders of Him? What did you think? Let me know!",

        "comment": "Rating: 4.5/5 stars\n\nBridget is about to become Crown Princess of Eldorra, and the last thing her Royal future will allow is falling for her bodyguard…\n\nThis was SO GOOD, y’all. Thanks first and foremost to the Twisted support group for peer pressuring me into pushing this to the top of my tbr. I had forgotten how much I LOVE a Royal romance, but this book checked every box—forbidden relationship? Political intrigue? Storybook settings? Yes yes and yes.\n\nI absolutely loved Bridget as an FMC—she was tough and no nonsense and fought for what she wanted. And RHYS…his grand gestures made me melt every time, I honestly loved him *so* much, and his backstory broke my heart. I also LOVED the way the third act breakup unfolded in this story—I’m usually not a fan (even though they almost always happen) but this one felt logical, fitting, and not contrived, and I appreciated the genuine growth of both MCs over the course of the book.\n\nI could go on…but I’m typing this review at 3am because I just finished reading, and I’m positive I’ll dissolve into incoherence pretty soon. Bottom line: this was a delight of a read from start to finish.\n\nRecommended to anyone, but especially if you like: Royal romance; forbidden-ish romance; political drama\n\nCW: Discussions of child abuse, alcoholism, death of parent; gun violence (on page); mentions of kidnapping",

        "comment": "|| 🌶️: 4/5 || ⭐️:3.75/5 || I am a little picky/specific with the books I like, but this one was a tiny bit underwhelming. I would rate this book a 3.75 but I had to put 4 because that’s not an option. When I read that this book was a forbidden romance, I immediately ordered it. The author is a great writer, but I wasn’t TOO obsessed with the storyline and the way things got to the end. The disliked: A lot of the story was a little repetitive, and I don’t think the story was slow burn enough. Yes, you could call it character development, but I fell in love with the cold hearted MMC in the beginning, and to see him turn into a snuggly bear only halfway through the book had me (only a little) forcing to finish it. Another thing is that sometimes the time would just skip a couple months or years and the readers are left a bit clueless even when you’re filled in. I want to see what happens in that time because I have FOMO. At the end, it kind of felt like it was rushing to the ending and the flame of being at the edge of my seat fizzled out. Yes, I get that the storyline kinda requires it, but just reading “2 years later” turns my stomach because I feel like I missed out on a lot! I also LOVE spice and I think she did a great job with the tension in the beginning, but it really died down towards the second half. It kind of felt like the last 3/4s of the book was them clearly in love while only the 1/4 was falling. I personally like more build up and slow burn. Also, I would’ve liked the FMC to be a bit more… dominant in bed sometimes. I LOVE how Rhys was, it’s hot, but I wanted to see him weak in the knees at one point, despite his big masculine persona. Information: The plot line is a hot bodyguard with a brutal past whom falls head over heals for his princess client. The story became quite predictable, but that’s okay, because I mainly started reading for the spice. Do not go into this book thinking it’s all spice, it’s not. It’s both spice and love equally, which is still nice. Things I liked: I really liked the beginning when Rhys ignored Bridget, and we got to see their tension and banter turn into love and passion. I would’ve loved more of that rather than royal politics consuming their story. I also like how the author added subtle hints of characters from the other books in this series sneaking around, to which I will be reading the rest. I skipped twisted love, however, because I read the reviews and just chose to dive right into this one, because the reviews said the author listened to her feedback making this book and the connection much better. I read some other reviews on the other books and will only be proceeding to read twisted hate, as I love the story line on that one. I know all of the books are good, I’m just picky!! My recommendation: I know no one asked lol, but I recommend it if you like romance book with some good spice and tension. However, if you’re more into tension and spice (the good stuff) than lovey dovey, I don’t recommend this book. I would probably recommend twisted hate, although I haven’t read it yet. If you’re reading the reviews and can’t decide whether to buy it or not, I suggest buying it, readinf up to half way, and if you don’t like the royal politics or get a little bored like I did, you can just pick up another book. (Anyway, I’m sorry if this review was a bit harsh, I’m just very picky and not into an overload of lovey dovey! Onto reading credence by Penelope Douglas next LMAO I’m not sure how I’ll be able to handle the drastic change.) Anyway, I recommend and it was a good read, just more so in the beginning :) It was a great book, and well written, just not for me!",

        "comment": "Having heard much raving about this series, I was poking around on Amazon when I saw this collector's edition. It is indeed gorgeous, although I do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark. The gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain, paper, black covers that are on most hardbacks today, and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf. It wasn't the first time I had bought a book for the cover.\n\nAside from hearing reviews from fans, I also saw a reference to the book when reading about Patricia A McKillip's _Winter Rose_, which I had recently read, and its connection to the ballad of Tam Lin. This same fairy tale apparently had influence on Holly Black's _Tithe_, also. Although the High Lord in Maas's tale is named Tamlin, the story is obviously a retelling of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" The story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon,\" wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear, and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich. Whereas neither \"Beauty and the Beast\" nor \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\" have fairy characters, aside from a witch or enchantress here and there, in the story Tam Lin, he is identified as an elf. In Maas's retelling, which court is cursed to wear masks, Tamlin's friend's mask is clearly stated as a fox, whereas Tamlin's mask is only vaguely described, and he is often referred to as a \"beast.\" The lack of description was a tad infuriating.\n\nWhile set in a fairy tale period of time past, the main character clearly has \"modern\" ideas. She has no mother and a weak father figure and, furthermore, was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters, despite the fact that she is the youngest. The family has only recently fallen into poverty, and the main character's upbringing has been neglected. She learns to hunt to feed the family, and, unlike the book-loving Belle of the Disney fairy tale, no one bothers to teach her how to read, although she is presented with a library, at which point, if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated, you now know for sure. According to the Internet, the character's name \"Feyre\" means \"Fair, Beautiful,\" like the name \"Belle.\" DYSWSDT? I myself am not a fan of retellings, and even less of \"modern\" retellings, although I do appreciate influences and notes here and there.\n\nAs a novel, the story has a single plot line. I have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion, but a novel requires a bit more substance. Although it was interesting enough for me to finish, I am not sure that I feel compelled to read the rest of the series, particularly if there is no matching collector's edition. For me, the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end, and I had already guessed the answer to the riddle. I found Feyre's modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire, and I found her difficult to like, which is basically how I feel about most \"strong female characters.\" I do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong. Stubborn, I can get. Stubborn and dumb at the same time? No.\n\nACOTAR has a Lexile score of 880, which puts it at the lower end of a 4th grade reading level (700-1160). You won't learn any new big words, and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the \"hero's journey\" template little to no deviation (i.e., no big surprises). It is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin, and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book, as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters. The descriptions of the fairy land (not merely a realm) were not as detailed as those in Julie Kagawa's _The Iron Fey_ series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals. The writing was a bit awkward at several points where one character's actions were in the same paragraph with another character's dialogue, so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader, and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas. So, was it bad? Obviously not that bad, since I finished it. Will I read more of her stories? I can't say for sure, but probably not unless they issue an attractive collector's edition worthy of the bookshelf. It satisfied my curiosity, but for Fey-related books, I recommend Jim Butcher's Dresden Series and Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey Series. Both have mind-blowing descriptions and intricacies. I'm always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if it's possible. So, I gave it three stars for being \"okay\" plus one for a really nice cover.",

        "comment": "This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars. I loved it!\n\nHere are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):\n\n★ FAIRYTALE RETELLING\nI was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling. I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas). However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings. Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie.\n\nI think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite. Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!). Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story. But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.\n\nThere were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed. For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items. However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party. I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him. Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting). So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel. Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the \"Beast\" story line. However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all.\n\nOverall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything. I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with. Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.\n\n★ GENRE\nWhile we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book. I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult. However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think \"Whoa! This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature.\"\n\nLooking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult. But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult. Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel. I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author. I personally have no problem with this genre. However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.\n\nI love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more. I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19). And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too. (There is no shame in my game... Because, who am I kidding? I have no game.) I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory.\n\nI'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer. She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places. I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.\n\n★ FEYRE, THE PROTAGONIST\nWhen I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien: a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool. However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human. She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character. Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to. She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).\n\nIn the beginning, Feyre is not very likable. She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed. But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way. Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting. Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures. Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.\n\n★ TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLE\nSince we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.\n\nTamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities. He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. But, he is not perfect. He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.\n\nHowever, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.\n\nBecause Rhysand.\n\nRhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre. And, I can't say that I hate him. I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre). He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.\n\nI am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan). I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.\n\n★ SUPPORTING CHARACTERS\nWhile Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.\n\nFirst, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend. He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her. They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief. He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.\n\nThere is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess. She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre. She is cold, calculating, and cruel. But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level, I find her evil ways to be too much at times. However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.\n\nAnd of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier. He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2. I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS\nMaas' Writing\nI believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best. As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person. Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters. But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.\n\nFaerie World\nI literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama). Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly. It seems like a literal heaven on earth.\n\nOther than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities. I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world. And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer. It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.\n\n***\n\nThere is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses. I LOVED this book! I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it. Because Sarah J. Maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.",

        "comment": "OH MY SWOONY DADDY GOODNESS! Elsie Silver truly can go no wrong- every book makes me fall madly in love, every couple perfectly tuned. Reckless completely WRECKED me- it’s charming, heart-hitting, poignant and swoony. Another all encompassing, heartfelt romance from Elsie Silver that swept me away completely. My heart is full of love - what a profound and perfect story of redemption and healing!\n\nTruthfully, I wasn’t sure if Reckless would own me in the way the other stories in this series have stolen me. Theo was charming but a bit of a cheeseball- could he really rise to the occasion of swoony leading man? And Winter had been a villain. We knew she’d been somewhat misunderstood, but even Summer’s rose-colored glasses could make me full buy into her being a likable heroine. But boy was I ever wrong about them both. Elsie effortlessly matures Theo into a heart-poundingly delicious leading man. He’s still bright and playful, flirty and fun-loving, but he’s also thoughtful, emotionally intelligent, patient and giving. Despite being a relatively straight forward character emotionally, he has a keen ability to see into the marrow of people, to find the core of them beneath what they project. And there is NO ONE who needs to be seen for who they truly are more than Winter. And Theo sees her- and sees her so well and so devotedly that he helps us as the reader see her in a new light. And in that light Elsie delivers perhaps one of the most compelling and emotionally rich redemption arcs for a heroine I’ve ever read. Winter is perhaps Elsie’s most compelling and layered heroines to date- she’s relatable, she’s flawed, she’s hurt and broken, and in all of that, she’s beautiful.\n\nWhat I love MOST about the redemption arc is that Elsie doesn’t actually alter who Winter is, and who we’ve seen her be. Yes, she’s done some crappy things, either willingly or passively. We learn more about her experiences and the decisions she’s made- but this is less about Elsie (or Winter) trying to explain away her choices and more about Winter finding a pathway forward- to forgiveness, redemption, and a path she wants for herself. Winter still has bite- she’s not bubbly or light. She’s not all of a sudden a warm carebear or a bright unicorn- she’s still Winter, stoic, reserved. But we see underneath all that to learn she’s also insecure, wracked with guilt and remorse, and so so very lonely. But she’s also really got a lot of love she wants to give. She’s thoughtful and reflective, self-aware and witty. There’s so much likable about her- so much endearing and delightful. And I am so glad Elsie gave us her story.\n\nTHEO is so damn swoony. I love a he- falls-first narrative, but Elsie practically reinvents, or perhaps elevates, the archetype in Theo. Theo falls hard, but he doesn’t fall blindly. From the first fiery and caustic encounter between these two, Theo lasers into all that is amazing about Winter. And what makes this story so precious is that he not only woos her so effortlessly (JAYSUS IS THIS MAN CHARMING!) but that he also helps her fall in love with herself too. He sees beneath the icey and biting defensive exterior into the heart of a woman who is a survivor, who is guarded because she’s been alone and unloved, a woman capable of love but denied a safe and supportive opportunity to exercise it. And that makes me fall in love with Theo all the more- that he so unapologetically loves Winter for ALL that she is, even when she’s moody and defensive. He’s the first to truly see her as more than “character” her family has cast for her- and that’s liberating in a way she’s terrified and thrilled by. And what a beautiful journey it is- to see her helping Theo grow into the man he wants while he liberates the heart of Winter beneath all her sharp edges and bite. And don’t even get me started on Theo with baby Vivi and his old man dog. I can’t even with the cuteness!\n\nBut Winter- well Winter stole my whole heart. I never expected to, but she’s the heroine in the series I relate the most to. She’s made mistakes that she owns and acknowledges but is scared to confront. She’s terrified of vulnerability because people have used that power against her, and for so long one narrative has been told about her that she almost feels powerless to not fall into the self-fulling prophecy of it. She’s fiercely broken and brokenly fierce, a soft heart wrapped in barbed wire. I think we’ve all felt a little bit unlovable at some point- I know I have. And that’s the core of Summer’s damage- she doesn’t feel lovable. At times invisible. The universalism of her emotional journey makes for a really meaningful character arc for her to find a love that not only shows her just how lovable she is but that also helps inspire her to stop hiding behind her walls and to lean into the “her” she wants to be. Their love is touching, powerful, and just so darn sweet.\n\nTheir chemistry is so fun- full of banter and teasing but also really tender and thoughtful. I just love the way THeo loves her- how perfectly he knows what she needs to hear, how easily he fields her edges and doubts. And she needs Theo in the way he wants to be needed- believes in and supports him in the way a true partner does. Theo charms, Winter barbs, and the fireworks ignite. Elsie gives this one a bit of a slower burn (ironic since it’s one night stand turned secret baby), and I loved watching them connect emotionally and TRULY build trust before they really go all in. Their love just feels really mature and considerate, two perfectly balanced elements that bring out the best in each other.\n\nI am just obsessed with this series- and I CAN NOT WAIT for Beau. I know it’s gonna be a heart-wrencher from what we saw in this story, and I am ready for all the angst. THis small town series can’t be missed- truly one of the best there is!",

I loved seeing winter and sloane’s friendship. sloane was one of her first real friends in chestnut springs and that made me so happy. I love seeing all our fav chestnut springs people together— there were so many eaton family get togethers and I was living for all of it!!!! one of my fav fictional fams of all time 🥰",

If you are looking for a dark and twisted book with a MMC who is a Psychopath with serial killer tendencies that he suppresses this book is for you. Killian is everything a woman would look for in a man from the outside looking in. He is a genius, going to med school, drop dead gorgeous what could be wrong with that. When Glyndon meets Killian she is on the cliffs edge and he gives her a choice but is it really a choice. From that moment on he becomes obsessed with her. This story is action packed and while we see Glyndon struggle with a past situation that has her thinking negatively we see a new Glyndon come out the more time she spends with Killian. First you will despise him for the way he goes about tormenting her but the more you read the more you are fascinated by him wanting to take care of and protect her all the while dominating her. For a man who has no ability to feel things he does love Glyndon and will burn the world down to protect her and make her his.",

Killian Carson - Reina and Asher's youngest son appears picture perfect. Not only is he gorgeous, but extremely intelligent, one of the youngest in his class attending medical school. Glyndon is the only and youngest daughter of Levi and Astrid King and an artist. Where Killian has serial killer tendencies and doesn't feel, Astrid is the complete opposite. She feels emotion too much. Unfortunately for her, she catches Killian's eyes and she is unable to match the force he brings by invading her life. These two both have demons in their life they try to suppress while maintaining the \"normal\" image of their friends and family. Killian is possessive and unable to control his most desired tendencies when it comes to Glyndons hold on him and vice versa. I loved reading about their story and how much they evolved throughout. I enjoyed the little crumbs we got from their friends and family. These second-generation kids are just starting, and the parallels between them and their parents are top-tier. Highly recommend this book and can't wait for the rest of the books in this series.",

With that being said I have been patiently waiting for the entire Legacy of Gods series to be published so I could binge them all at once!! HOWEVER I could not hold off any longer. And man am I glad I did not wait. Killian is a true psycho, his lack of emotions and constant desire to kill make him dark to the extreme with still having control of his urges so he does not become completely unhinged. Glyndon I was a little concerned with in the beginning with her thoughts if suicide (please check triggers), I worried that Killian might push her further with his own basket of crazy but of course he did the complete opposite and brought her to a better place. Of course the twist toward the end is always the best part and I will say that I had my suspicions about that specific twist but it did not take anything away from the book at all. I cannot wait to devour the rest of the series that is currently out and then have to wait (somewhat impatiently) for the rest to be published. Come on Rina!! Don’t make a girl wait too long.\n\n-Kayla/Hot.Bookmance",

Lincoln is hooked from that first text. He wants to find out all about the beautiful girl who has no clue who he is.\nShe only knows his first name. She comes from a broken home, mom overdosed when she was 10 and she has been in the system ever since and recently ran away from her last fosterhome right before turning 18. She trusts no one and barely get by working two jobs and tries to finish school at night.\n\nThe text every day until on day Monroe calls him because she is scared to walk home alone. They have this great chemistry even on text. They meet by accident at one of Monroe’s catering jobs and Lincoln already decides that he would never let her go again. He goes to great lenghts to get her to depend on him.\n\nHe definently falls first. He is way beyond morally grey. Like he is all head first diving into the blackzone. Totally obsessed with Monroe. If this had not been a fictional romance book, he would probably be behind bars or at least have had a restrainingorder.\nBut guess what. I still loved this book.\nHe has a lot of baggage from hos no good parents and Monroe does too. These two just complete eachother and finally both get a person in their live who loves them for all. Good and bad. And one who stays no matter what.\n\nI love it. And i can’t wait to read Ari’s story too.\nThis book might be dark in some places but it still has all the banter with the best friend and other hockeydudes.

        "comment": "Great story. Well written, flows well, doesn’t stall or feel awkward, steam adds to the story but doesn’t feel forced and yet I’m not sure how I feel about Lincoln. Usually I absolutely LOVE the complicated and sometimes deplorable characters, the ones you aren’t supposed to love but they have such complexity that you can’t help but love them but Lincoln has me seriously unsure. He’s complex, I WANT to love him, but I can’t seem to.\n\nI think my inability to like him comes from how he dealt with certain circumstances and situations and knowing Monroe’s full backstory and those things just clash.\n\n(SPOILERS????)\nTo start, there is a difference between loving care and dependency and while he was doing things behind her back with loving intention, they weren’t done in a loving manner and were more done in a way to ensure she was dependent on him which yikes. Instead of talking to her and discussing that he didn’t like the lack of safety at her apartment complex and talking about finding her a new place (which she had been trying to do) he made extreme moves and had her evicted to move her in. I think this is where I started having problems with Lincoln, because with Monroe losing her mother at 10 and being bounced from foster home to foster home she was used to unsteady ground and needed stability but she also needed to have a say and he took that from her. She needed to be able to have some control in her life after free falling for so long and here comes this sexy guy with swagger and he just takes it. I understand where he was coming from a place of concern but he was allowing that concern to warp into something manipulative and took away her freedom. I feel like had he at least mentioned concern for her safety at the apartment that even if he’d eventually followed the same actions he did that I would have been able to like him more because he wasn’t just bulldozing his way into her life to make her completely dependent on him.\n\nStill overall a great story that I did enjoy, I am just unable to be fully a fan of Lincoln, says the girl who screamed when Max died in The Resident (I like those complicated characters).",

He took obsession to new levels and I loved reading the chapters in his pov. His thoughts were so consumed by Monroe, it was a little funny at times.\n\nHe knew when he was acting crazy but he didn’t care, Monroe had him in such a chokehold that he knew he’d do whatever it took to keep her, to be able to take care of her, to essentially force her to realized that she was as obsessed with him as he was with her. Did his obsession push a little too far at one point? Sure, you could say that. Did I still enjoy reading every second of it? Absolutely.\n\nMonroe was never truly able to trust or rely on anybody, until Lincoln came along. He made sure he was always there when she needed him, made sure to reassure her any time she had lingering doubts — which is probably why it didn’t take long for her to become so attached. Her obsession was just as bad as his, even if she tried to pretend it wasn’t at times. I love that he continuously told her he loved her (even though she wouldn’t say it back) so early on because the idea of ever letting her go never crossed his mind and he was aware that keeping her by his side was the only answer.\n\nAgain, I reiterate: THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD. I didn’t even need to think about what I was going to rate it when the time came. Immediate 5 stars.\n\nP.S. wth was up with Ari in Epilogue no. 2???? 👀",

        "comment": "Tali (not a fan of the name) was a better heroine than the one from the Summer We Fell, but I will admit I didn’t start off liking her. She was too judgmental of Hayes. I could understand if she somewhat was if she knew him, but at the time, when they first met, she did not and she criticized him for everything he did.\nThankfully, as she got to know him, she realized he was fighting demons just like her and just like everyone, was handling them the best he could.\nMy heart mostly broke Hayes. He definitely had the harder times, before he was successful. His loneliness bled through the pages, and I thought it was sweet once Tali realized this and started doing small things to take care of him.\nIt was also sweet how she was able, the consummate caretaker of her family, was able to lean on him. He was so protective of her. Good ‘ole Jonathon for setting them up, but also warning Hayes away from her when he knew she was still having a hard time when Hayes was first smitten with her. I loved, too, how they both leant on eachother and teamed up against their toxic exes.\nThese two were perfect for eachother, and good ‘ole Jonathon verbally smacked Tali upside the head when he made her realized how selfish and hurtful she had been to Hayes (unprovoked) when she left for Kansas (though I think he deserved better than a TEXT message as an apology!)\nThat being said, overall it was a good read. Glad none of the exes got to weasel their way back in, and Sam was a waste of a character unless he has his own book with Charlotte in the future.\nThe epilogue was too short though. I would have liked to read more of their future and I hate that you have to sign up for a newsletter to read a 2page extra scene.",

This book has all the feels with their highs and lows. I am looking forward to the next book I read by this author.",

I love when my h are intelligent and funny and the H can't get enough of it. No worries. A very satisfying story with no betrayals and an HEA.",
