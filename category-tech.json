    "synopsis": "From the author of Steve Jobs and other bestselling biographies, this is the astonishingly intimate story of the most fascinating and controversial innovator of our era—a rule-breaking visionary who helped to lead the world into the era of electric vehicles, private space exploration, and artificial intelligence. Oh, and took over Twitter.\n\nWhen Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.\n\nHis father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.\n\nIt was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.\n\nFor two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?",

    "synopsis": "The Financial Times Business Book of the Year, this epic account of the decades-long battle to control one of the world’s most critical resources—microchip technology—with the United States and China increasingly in fierce competition is “pulse quickening…a nonfiction thriller” (The New York Times).\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that microchips are the new oil—the scarce resource on which the modern world depends. Today, military, economic, and geopolitical power are built on a foundation of computer chips. Virtually everything—from missiles to microwaves—runs on chips, including cars, smartphones, the stock market, even the electric grid. Until recently, America designed and built the fastest chips and maintained its lead as the #1 superpower, but America’s edge is in danger of slipping, undermined by players in Taiwan, Korea, and Europe taking over manufacturing. Now, as Chip War reveals, China, which spends more on chips than any other product, is pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US. At stake is America’s military superiority and economic prosperity.\n\nEconomic historian Chris Miller explains how the semiconductor came to play a critical role in modern life and how the US became dominant in chip design and manufacturing and applied this technology to military systems. America’s victory in the Cold War and its global military dominance stems from its ability to harness computing power more effectively than any other power. Until recently, China had been catching up, aligning its chip-building ambitions with military modernization.\n\nIlluminating, timely, and fascinating, Chip War is “an essential and engrossing landmark study\" (London Times).",

        "comment": "Producing advanced technology requires more than a set of instructions. In today’s world, we hear about reverse engineering and technology espionage of the most advanced tech, often extracted from the research halls or computer servers of U.S. facilities. But Chris Miller’s “Chip War” clarifies and corrects common misconceptions about cheap and “easy” reverse engineering. Cheap, maybe yes. But if there is an advanced computer chip involved, not easy and likely not a copy at all.\n\nAs of 2021, the most advanced logic chips, also known as semiconductors, were produced in only two companies, Samsung and TSMC located in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan respectively. The various phases of chip production, research, design, fabrication and installation are shared between dozens of companies across North America, Asia and Europe. But the most advanced chips require the precision tooling made available by only one company located in the Netherlands.\n\nAs Chris Miller explains, the “Chip War” is about understanding the risks of globalized supply chains, the importance of specially-funded research and the tenacity to keep up in a game where any system that relies on a chip can be outdated, obsolete or out-maneuvered by the following generation of chips. Chip capacity doubles in processing speed and memory capacity every two years. Known as “Moore’s Law” after one of the seminal researchers of early chip development, chip designers continue to find ways to replace key ingredients, carve or lase smaller grooves onto silicon wafers and double the processing power of every day gadgets and the latest Artificial Intelligence-enabled weapons systems. Since at least 2019, the processing power increase has doubled every six months!\n\nThe book's subtitle hints at the fact that winning the access, if not harnessing control of the latest chip generation, is critical to maintaining dominance not only on the battle field but on the trading floor and the farthest reaches of space exploration. It is not an understatement to suggest that the Soviet Union lost the cold war due to its inability to keep pace with computer chip advances. Today, Russia is 100% dependent on non-Russian companies to supply its advanced chips and decades behind in designing and fabricating today’s most advanced chips.\n\nThe same is not exactly said for China. But like other advanced technologies, self-sufficiency requires a robust system of interconnected education structures, research, production feedback, creativity and a healthy dose of business risk aversion coupled with massive injects of investment capital. Here in 2023, China had still not built an indigenous capacity necessary to produce and keep up with the latest advances in chip production; which is also a critical component in AI.\n\nIt’s not enough to describe the contemporary Chip War without understanding the complexity and fascinating history of the chip’s development. I like how Miller begins his book describing the WWII and post-WWII era of computing and the space race that spurred the advances in chip making. The early book chapters help provide context for why simply stealing and studying a chip is not enough to replicate it. And given Moore’s Law, not keeping pace with chip advances will always leave a company or product years behind in competitive capability.\n\nNASA was the first to provide monetary incentive for the early chip giants with the chips enabling better and better rocket technology. The US Department of Defense then took the helm in catalyzing the chip race. The DoD was fortunate to have people like Under Secretary of Defense for Research, William Perry, in the 1970’s who understood the complexities and necessities of computer chip applications.\n\nBut with global demand came an increasingly complex global supply chain where chip companies died, were bought out, moved out or were pushed out by new companies taking advantage of cheaper production markets, even if the chip design kings remained in the U.S. Japanese companies like Sony, Toshiba, Hitachi and NEC dominated chip production in the 1980s with the Republic of Korea not far behind. Assembly plants popped up in Southeast Asia. The U.S. today is only 2% of the global chip market. China (PRC) and Taiwan are center-stage in the so-called chip wars.\n\nChina is still unable to produce the most sophisticated chips, relying on an ironic geo-political reality, Taiwan, for the majority of its advanced chips. In 2015, China and Taiwan’s chip sectors almost merged under massive political and economic pressure from the People’s Republic of China but today the mood and posturing is much different. Taiwan has friends who increasingly understand the importance not only of Taiwan’s democracy and autonomy but also its irreplaceable tech contributions.\n\nUnlike nuclear technology which has not changed much in decades, chip technology as it contributes to ever-faster computing, forming the “synapses” of 5/6G and AI, is the real game changer and the ultimate “weapon” to win any war or contribute to humanity's development, as Chris Miller would have us believe. I highly suggest you read the book for yourself and begin contemplating how semiconductor production could be as geo-politically powerful as crude oil extraction. It certainly shifts the fault lines of thought and geography.",

        "comment": "Chip War is a well timed history of semiconductor manufacturing and the intellectual currents that drove offshoring as well as bring concern over national security. The book is both historically informative as well as currently illuminating for thinking about the current US - China frictions on semiconductor manufacturing. One can learn about the pioneers of the industry and the history of government involvement as well as the cycles of intellectual property concerns. Chip War is both highly relevant for better understanding today's world of widening geopolitical fault lines as well as contextualizing how similar and or different things are today vs the past.\n\nThe book starts out something along the lines of Walter Isaacson's Innovators giving the history of silicon valley and the discovery of transistor by Bardeen and Brattain, and then Shockley. The key characters who built up Silicon Valley and the entrepreneurial spirit that they embodied is highlighted so that one gets a sense of the early days in the valley. The competitiveness but also fluidity of the system led to significant innovation in the early days and the author gives a picture of the ecosystem. The first construction of the integrated circuit is discussed and the early development of logic chips is highlighted. The author is quick to highlight that copying technology is no route to success as its not technical knowledge but process expertise which is critical, understanding how to scale the business and increase yields is the key to consumer businesses which are critical for true scale. The Soviet Union attempted to catch up on semi-conductors via espionage which was a strategy destined for failure and the author gives the strong reminder that innovation is what drives the business not replication. At the early stages of the tech revolution the US dominated but was insulated from competition.\n\nThe author moves on to the world as the conditions changed and Japan caught up. At first it was licensing technology on lower end goods but with Sony and others the tech gap narrowed and it looked like Japan was on the track to outpace the US. The US appeared to be lagging a more disciplined competitor with subsidized capital that was more cost competitive. Thus the reader gets a reminder that tech competition is not new and there is a strong reminiscence today of the competition with Japan in the 80s. Ultimately the concerns about Japan were overblown and eventually the US regained its intellectual lead where its competitive edge was strongest but with the exception of Micron, tech hardware manufacturing was slowly moving offshore. The author then moved on to the origins of TSMC and a little bit on Samsung. In particular for TSMC one learns that Morris Chang, founder of TSMC was a TI executive and not actually Taiwanese. Nonetheless the story of the rise of Taiwan in the tech supply chain is discussed and the relevance of the ambiguity with regards to China completely overlooked. The era of offshoring was the era of globalization where cost efficiencies were what determined capex decisions and the US government was not in the business of subsidizing capital despite the rest of Asia fully embracing that.\n\nThe author moves on to China and the growth of a new kind of competitor. This competition was not as concerning until the last decade. Huawei is discussed as is the IP theft from Micron and the challenges of moving up the curve is highlighted with the lack of progress by SMIC. Chip Wars does a good job of bringing in the need of cutting edge processes for military dominance and the greater frictions that are arising due to these security concerns with China that were absent with prior competitions. The disregard of intellectual property is also highlighted through the Micron fiasco where Chinese courts used their system to blackmail Micron, though this backfired. Finally the author moves on to EUV and the astronomical complexity of the manufacturing process. The true complexity is used to show the fundamental challenge of trying to fast track your way to the cutting edge of tech hardware manufacturing. It is also used to highlight the truly global collaborative environment that was embraced to develop the technology and that same environment also led to offshore from the US without a concern.\n\nWe are now in a new era where supply chain stability is being reconsidered as more important than supply chain cost. For technology this has big repercussions. On the margin we can certainly see the reverberations with the chip equipment export constraints and it is likely that these are used on a continued basis to manage competition in a fundamentally different way than in the past. To understand the history so that one can better appreciate the context, Chip War is a must read.",

        "comment": "This book, “Building a Brand Story: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen,” by Donald Miller, is a gem summing up college semesters worth of information on story-telling and construction into actionable steps for the reader and business owner to apply in a fundamental way that is easy to digest. This alone proves the book to be invaluable, yet additionally it provides peace of mind that eliminates doubt and instills a sense of confidence in sharing the story behind the brand or business that leads to more satisfied customers and more business.\n\nI’ve only begun the book the day before yesterday, and today I found myself on pgs 75-77 with an example that made me put down the book and log into my Amazon account just so that I could leave a ‘review’ as there is an interesting dynamic at play here! Perhaps with my reading a little late, the Copyright 2017 (by Donald Miller), and as of today it is July of 2021 I have the gift of hindsight in being able to share my perspective on this particular example and perhaps pose an interesting point.\n\nUnder the heading ‘The Fatal Mistake’, which maybe ironic (again, I haven't finished the book yet!). In reference to the brand ‘Tidal’ the author states “Rapper Jay Z founded the company with a personal investment of a whopping $56 million [...],” and goes on to conclude that “Tidal existed to help the artist win the day, not customers [...].”\n\nIn spring of this year (2021) Jay-Z reportedly sold Tidal for $302 million which reportedly increased his net worth by 40%. This may or may not be true however it is worth noting in taking a look further at the example in the book!\n\nMaybe The Artist is ‘The Customer’, The Industry is ‘The Villain’, Those Who Pay are ‘The Hero(es)’, and the brand (‘Tidal’) is ‘The Guide’. This would make sense as Jay-Z gave us ‘the blueprint’ and seems to me liberating, not fatal. It’s a win-win for the artist (who gets paid more their worth) and the customer (who would pay for any other streaming service, gets to be ‘The Hero’ who uses their coin to set the artist free from ‘The Villain’).\n\nI’ve always respected Jay-Z as an artist and lyricist (he is not in my Top 3 Favorite Rappers Dead or Alive, but in my Top 5 depending on the day), however this example highlighted for me his magnificence as a storyteller and brilliance as a businessman. I just had somewhat of an ‘aha’ moment which truly opened my eyes as I’ve heard talk of this about him before and didn’t fully comprehend the skill involved (which this book has helped me be able to do).\n\nAgain, great book! Worth every penny. My mind is blown and I'm not even on page 100! I’m getting back to it now, just wanted to make that point. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their storytelling abilities, as it is an important, if not vital life skill for everyone, including those who are building a brand.\n\n(THANK YOU!)",

        "comment": "First of all, as a true techie, I love Wolfram's work, not the physics, but his elegant, refreshing and bold contribution to mathematics and creating tools to bring that complexity to everybody. His first go at it, Mathematica put so many modes of computation on one's desktop as a standalone. This includes ultra high precision (seemingly un-limited digits), way powerful symbolic calculations including complex algebra expression factoring, equation solving, graphing, and full differential and integral calculus, and to top it off, rule-based logic and far more.\nYou have to wait until the later chapters for it, but after explaining the brain-dead simplicity of neural network \"learning\", he figuratively destroys ChatGPT, dismembering it, and thrusting its flaws at the reader's face for all to see. I found it shocking, but most fascinating, as he describes why fixing ChatGPT's Achilles heel will be near impossible and certainly not worth the effort.\nChatGPT which works on such a brute force simple single principle, neural net weightings, can never be a match for real intelligence crafted into a product. I love geniuses who later in life wax philosophical (If you do, check out Irwin Schrodinger's \"What is Life\" and his [20 years later] \"My View of the World\". Steven Wolfram is definitely a computational genius, with a divine gift of designing, creating, and polishing the highest mathematical tools, and then giving them to the world. As such he is entitled to wax philosophical, too.\nAs a religious Jew, and I think anyone religious would agree, no amount of appending the most fitting next nucleotide into a string of DNA will produce something as complex as a housefly, all the more so a human - sorry Darwin. All the top NASA engineers and scientists can not come close to the fly's taking and landing ability on any angled surface, its ability to evade capture by a human being by quickly seeing and evaluating trajectories 100's of times per second, its ability see in a myriad of directions simultaneously, its getting its energy from simple waste materials, and its manufacturing ability to replicate thousands of itself from those same materials in record time.\n\nSteven Wolfram has thus done humanity a great service. Fear no longer. This wave of AI is brain dead and will not take over the world, not with its lack of the most elementary mathematical, or even arithmetical ability.\n\nAs I thank Steven Wolfram for his perfectionist products, and enjoy reading his books large and small, I hope he will understand that to my mind, he has made it clear that, in the most similar way, his taking down of ChatGPT by exposing its limitations of its simple technique of choosing the best 'atom' to append, he has, in one glorious stroke, also eviscerated Darwin and exposed the extreme stupidity of believing that random mutations plus survival of the fittest (picking the most fitting next DNA 'letter') can ever compete with an alternative such as truly thoughtful and intelligent crafting and designing.\n\nWolfram refreshingly blurts out the truth. I agree and will close, sharing that expecting Darwin's theory to produce life is now as foolish as expecting ChatGPT to calculate numbers, to take one example, to calculate Pi to even a few dozen places, a task Wolfram's tools now can all do in a split second.\nTo also put it bluntly, after reading \"What Is ChatGPT doing ... and Why Does It Work?\" , knee jerk use of science or technology to defend atheism, is no longer an effective option.",

Now the first two are being executed somewhat unreliably by an upgraded pattern completion device, the transformer. This device depends on the artificial neural network, invented only slightly more recently than the stored program digital computer, itself.\n\nStephen Wolfram, who is well known for adapting language to computational thinking, wrote a good introduction aimed at someone who knows at least a little about the technology. Nevertheless, the slog is hard through engineering embellishments like embedding, attention, positional marking, and connection dropping. The software is a true black box, in any case. It happens to work. But there is little to gain by contemplating the billions of processing elements and hundreds of billions of connections. You might as well try to understand the mystery of intelligent life by contemplating the electrochemical complexity of grey matter.\n\nStephen Wolfram wishes to tame the gpt technology by interfacing it to his precisely defined tools for computation. He shows clearly that ChatCPT is unreliable when faced with something even slightly computational. The hope is that the transformer will benefit from the disciplines of Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica. I look forward to following the progress here. But as a retiree , I think I'll stay directly with the human generated, edited, and referenced articles of Wikipedia.",

The whole thing is a fun idea, with unique classes and abilities that are an interesting mix of fantasy and sci fi. The biggest downside for me is that both the MC and one of the largest supporting characters are both distinctly unlikable for most of the book if not all of it.

        "comment": "This book is brilliant.\nI cannot decide what I loved most about it – whether it was the superb conversational tone, amazingly solid business advice or that Allan actually preaches what he practices (which happens depressingly rare nowadays).\n\nAre there any flaws in “The 1-Page Marketing Plan?” Only perceived ones and only a few. Let’s start with them.\nCons\n\n1. Give them what they want…\nThe author tricks you into buying the book with his 1-page slogan. And he provides that indeed. But it’s just the tip of the tip of the iceberg. You get the tip and the whole iceberg attached to it.\n…then give them what they need.\nAnd it’s a huge iceberg to swallow. The amount of content condensed into this book is mind-blowing.\n\n2. More for Rookies.\nThis book is ideal for people who are getting their feet wet in the entrepreneurial world. I found only a couple missing elements in the whole structure of Allan’s business program. But it also means that if you have some experience in business you have probably heard of or lived through most of the advice provided in the book.\n\nOn the plus side, Allan has a talent for conveying his points in a way that penetrates thick skulls. So, even if it’s something you are familiar with it still may make you take action.\n\n3. Missing puzzles.\nWhat small business owners need is a full operation manual for their businesses and the author provides just that. With two exceptions I could put my finger on: there is nothing, or very little, about a vision for your business and idea validation at its early stages. Yeah, I know, it’s nitpicking. 1-page Marketing Plan is dedicated to existing business owners and assumes they have a vision and validated their idea. However, if you cover the whole picture, you shouldn’t make exceptions.\n\nPROS\n\n1. From Practice.\nI cannot praise the author enough for his book marketing. I make a living as a book advertiser. Gosh! So many authors, even business book authors, have no clue about it. I need to teach them basics before we can even start.\nAllan Dib is a superb marketer. His book is #1 in a competitive category and it ranks high consistently, meaning he knows how to actually sell his own book.\n\nThe same experience shines through the pages of his book. Allan has been there and done that. “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” is not a theoretical thesis. It comes straight from experience. I appreciate this very much.\n\n2. Advice\nAs I mentioned in the ‘Cons’ section, Allan shares much more than a single marketing tactic. His business advice is rock solid and truly comprehensive. It is also up to date like a few business books are. For example, the utmost emphasis on tracking your marketing campaigns is, of course, common sense, but in the modern world it is also a must.\n\n“Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” – John Wanamaker\n“It should be a crime to say that today.” – Allan Dib\n\nAllan is not shy about admitting that he borrows heavily from Gerber and his “E-Myth.” If you want to build a real business, not just a new job without a boss (and without a stable salary), you need systems and processes. Your marketing needs a system and processes as well and “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” tells you exactly how to implement them.\n\nThe business advice shared in the book is especially valuable for business rookies who haven’t yet read everything from the business shelf in the library.\n\n3. Wisdom.\nAllan Dib’s advice does not focus only on systems and processes. His business acumen is enormous and he is generous in sharing it. For me, it was especially visible when he talks about relationships with customers. I need to nurture those relationships not consider them a given. Allan also knows which particular stories to share to make his point memorable. The story of a car salesman opened my eyes to what it means to keep relationships with customers alive.\n“Everybody is in sales” was another business wisdom nugget I got from “The 1-Page Marketing Plan.”\nAnd author’s assessment about big organizations was right on the spot:\n\n“Poor service, indifferent staff, and out-of-touch management are hallmarks of large companies.”\n\nI’ve been working in a corporate environment my whole career and there are no words that describe this world more aptly.\n\nI also liked very much whenever Allan gave arguments about why small businesses actually have advantage over big corporations, if they do their marketing right.\n\nAnother of his gems:\n\n“Word of mouth is the business equivalent of a free lunch.”\n\nThat’s so true. It’s amazing when it happens, but depending on free meals is not a strategy to support your family or create a business.\n\nFiring problematic customers, not basing your business on a single snow leopard, how to give outrageous guarantees and many other wisdom gems were hidden among this book’s pages.\n\n4. Storytelling.\nWhile many of the things Allan teaches about in his book were not new to me, his storytelling is so superb that many things I knew only intellectually finally penetrated to the gut level.\n\nFor example, I knew very well that it’s so much more effective to keep an existing customer than to attract a new one. They taught me this in my economy classes at university 20 years ago! But only after reading the “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” it dawned on me how downright stupid it is to neglect your past and existing customers and chase new clients instead.\n\nI’m a numbers guy and I was impressed at how Allan used numbers to illustrate his points.\nThus, even if you “kind of” already know everything about marketing, systems, processes and keeping your customers satisfied, reading “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” will not be waste of your time. The author’s persuasion skills may refresh your knowledge and implement what you know intellectually into practice.\n\n5. 1-Page\nAnd yes, there is a 1-page marketing plan included in the book.\n\nIn my opinion, it’s well worth the book’s price. Even the principle that you should have only one place, one sheet, to picture your whole marketing plan with a single glance is worth the price. We are so distracted in the modern world. This single piece may serve you as a single point of focus that will keep your monkey brain glued to the importance of marketing plan for your business.\n\nSo, even if you already know everything Allan teaches about marketing, customer satisfaction, market research, systems and processes and all that stuff, but you didn’t have your whole marketing plan put on a single sheet, you need to read “The 1-Page Marketing Plan”\n\nBy the way, the plan is thoroughly well-laid out in a chronological and logical order. It’s a masterpiece. I’m going to use it in my business.",

        "comment": "Persuaded:\nI will admit that I picked this book up with grave misgivings. I was asked by the author’s assistant to review the book but declined to do so. Coincidentally, a week later, one of my clients was looking for a way to get his leadership team on the same page when it came to marketing and sales. So, I picked up the Kindle version of the book and promised I’d let him know what I thought.\n\nBy the time I finished the introduction, I was shaking my head in agreement with Mr. Dib. Halfway through the book, I was confident enough to recommend that my client get the book for himself. Let me explain some of the reasons why I believe this book is worth your time to read.\n\nLayout:\nThe chapters are in a logical order that builds from one marketing principle to another while working toward completing the plan. There are frequent referrals between concepts that tie everything together.\n\nI appreciate the way Dib starts each chapter with a summary and a list of what he will be telling you in that chapter. Then, at the end of each chapter, he has an action item and instructions for filling in one block of the nine-block marketing plan.\n\nMarketing:\nIt is refreshing to read that Dib believes there is no longer (and maybe never was) a reason for not doing the work of determining the return on investment (ROI) for your marketing budget. Technological advances in digital media make parts of the ROI equation very easy to manage. Print media is also much more targeted and traceable than in the past. So, no excuses! Continuous improvement in marketing effectiveness is possible and required for a well-run business.\n\nDib also dispels the myth that print and direct marketing are \"dead,\" or dying. He drives home the concept that all the media can be useful and should be used in a mix that is most effective for your target market. Also, yes, some of the determination of the proper combination will be trial-and-error which is why measuring is so critical.\n\nOn the target market subject, Dib suggests that a narrow focus is best. We cannot be all things to all people in all markets. Combine a narrow focus with the creation of a customer avatar, and you will be able to create a powerful model for marketing and sales personnel to use as a guide for their work.\n\nThere are many other great tips and ideas for a highly effective marketing program; too many to itemize here. As I mentioned above, it is well worth your time to read what Dib has to say.\n\nSales:\nMarketing and sales are very closely intertwined. Generally, the sales process is where I disagree with most sales and marketing trainers or authors on these topics. Try as they might, they cannot seem to get to the point where they stop making the process about making the sale. Many start out saying the right things: “It’s about the buyer; You must add value; You must build trust, etc.\" Then, inevitably, they wind up inculcating tactics that make things all about the salesperson making the sale. Find out what your customer needs – so you can make the deal. Build a relationship with your customer, because that is what will make them comfortable placing the order. Always be closing.\n\nDib has come the closest I've seen so far to reaching my own sales philosophy – if you want someone to buy, stop selling. People want to buy; they do not want to be sold – no matter how pleasant you are as a salesperson. Today, if I want or need something, I have researched it already, and I either have it or have decided it’s not in my budget. Therefore, if you’re trying to manipulate me (no matter what fancy tactic you use) into purchasing something I don’t need or can’t afford, then you’re serving yourself and not me as the customer.\n\nThe most egregious sales tactics today are those based on neuroscience. They are designed to use new knowledge about how the human brain works to manipulate people into doing what you want them to do rather than help them understand what it is they want to do. To me, doing that is evil. As a vendor, my job is to be found. That, being found, is why this book is so important and worth reading.\n\nDefinitions:\nDib uses an interesting story to define some of the common terms we use around marketing and sales. “Here's the simplest, most jargon-free definition of marketing you're ever likely to come across: If the circus is coming to town and you paint a sign saying, ‘Circus Coming to the Showground Saturday,’ that’s advertising. If you put the sign on the back of an elephant and walk it into town, that’s promotion. If the elephant walks through the mayor’s flower bed and the local newspaper writes a story about it, that’s publicity. And if you get the mayor to laugh about it, that’s public relations. If the town’s citizens go to the circus, you show them the many entertainment booths, explain how much fun they’ll have spending money at the booths, answer their questions and, ultimately, they spend a lot at the circus, that’s sales. And if you planned the whole thing, that’s marketing.”\n\nAs you might imagine, my difficulty is only with the portion that states, you “explain how much fun they’ll have spending money at the booths.” Just show them the booths. They’ll figure out if they want to spend time and money having fun.\n\nBottom Line:\nAs I said, Dib comes closest to meeting my \"don't sell\" sales philosophy. Moreover, he is right on target with the marketing, branding, and promoting philosophy. This book is the most lucid and most thorough book on this topic that I've read to date. Also, Dib has more useful resources on his website for those who want to dig deeper. I highly recommend the 1-Page Marketing Plan.",

        "comment": "If you want to learn to code, don't hesitate and pick this book up now. Not only is the book well written, Python, the language the book is written about, is one of the most simple programming languages in the world. Being simple doesn't exactly make it weak either. Python is an incredibly powerful language. PCBs such as Rasberry Pi uses Python as its programming language. The book explains things well enough that they can be understood. However, older concepts are not rementioned, so taking notes is almost a necessity if you want to clearly read this book, which can be a little bit of a hassle. Some of the things you learn are:\nValues\nOperators\nVariables\nFormatting Strings\nType Casting\nLists and Tuples\nDictionaries\nInteractive Programs\nSpecial Characters\nCondition Statements\nIf Statements\nLoops\nFunctions\nModules\nExternal Files\nClasses\nObjects\nProperties\nName Mangling\nSelf\nChild Classes & Objects: The Concept of Inheritance\nBuilt-In Python Functions for Objects.\nAll of these are written clearly enough. I don't understand what others mean by \"not for beginners\". The concept of coding is quite complex. Unlike Scratch, we don't get a list of a syntax whose names tell us what they do. Explaining coding easily is a very difficult task. Somebody said that there were better Python coding books out there. There are plenty of people that would say that these \"better books\" are worse than this book. Don't just read it like a normal book. You will not know how to code because you read this book once. Think about it. If you simply read over a textbook like a novel, you would not have memorized the concepts and diagrams. This book is not built to be read like a novel. Some people say that it was difficult, but I have not seen many problems with this book.",

His TLC method is simple and potent, and covers the essential success factors needed for any side hustle.\n\nMiles presents it in an easy to understand way and provides anecdotes and examples that hammer home the points.

As a member of his inner circle community we could see this up close and every day (because he was working with us every single day). The quote from the book below says it all.\n\nA solid plan and great execution are how we win over and wow customers.

    "synopsis": "It’s not just computers—hacking is everywhere.\n\n\n\nLegendary cybersecurity expert and New York Times best-selling author Bruce Schneier reveals how using a hacker’s mindset can change how you think about your life and the world.\n\n\n\n\nA hack is any means of subverting a system’s rules in unintended ways. The tax code isn’t computer code, but a series of complex formulas. It has vulnerabilities; we call them “loopholes.” We call exploits “tax avoidance strategies.” And there is an entire industry of “black hat” hackers intent on finding exploitable loopholes in the tax code. We call them accountants and tax attorneys.\n\n\n\n\nIn A Hacker’s Mind, Bruce Schneier takes hacking out of the world of computing and uses it to analyze the systems that underpin our society: from tax laws to financial markets to politics. He reveals an array of powerful actors whose hacks bend our economic, political, and legal systems to their advantage, at the expense of everyone else.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you learn how to notice hacks, you’ll start seeing them everywhere—and you’ll never look at the world the same way again. Almost all systems have loopholes, and this is by design. Because if you can take advantage of them, the rules no longer apply to you.\n\n\n\n\nUnchecked, these hacks threaten to upend our financial markets, weaken our democracy, and even affect the way we think. And when artificial intelligence starts thinking like a hacker—at inhuman speed and scale—the results could be catastrophic.\n\n\n\n\nBut for those who would don the “white hat,” we can understand the hacking mindset and rebuild our economic, political, and legal systems to counter those who would exploit our society. And we can harness artificial intelligence to improve existing systems, predict and defend against hacks, and realize a more equitable world.",

I was impressed with the depth of knowledge on current cyber security issues, hacking for the benefit of society not government so that government misuses resources. Last half of book Bruce discusses the threats posed by artificial intelligence and how alert cyber defense can thwart AI. My only disappointment in the book was that he did not talk about how to hack your education. Bruce talks a lot about taxes and more taxing but nowhere do I find suggestions like education hacks especially for urban and rural American students suffering from massive learning losses caused by school shutdowns supported by teacher unions and their democratic party allies. How can these students hack their education without having to go through the grind of tests, classes and student loan debt.",

        "comment": "If your mind's image of 'hacking' is someone in a hoodie bent over a keyboard, Schneier is here to show that hacking, which he describes as flouting the intent of rules but not the letter, has a long history of which he provides many examples over the centuries (turducken!). This is not a technical book, but a cautionary examination of how loopholes and novel interpretations have pervaded our society - sometimes for good, but more often for the benefit of a few.\n\nSchneier spends quite a bit of text on AI and the risks he sees coming when it becomes more widely used. It was interesting to see that he thought, when he finished the manuscript mid-2022, that we perhaps had a few more years before AI became a big issue. He writes a lot about GPT-3, but the earthquake that is ChatGPT came sooner than most anyone imagined.\n\nI found the discussion of legal and financial system hacks to be fascinating and worrisome, and I am doubtful that any of the mitigations he describes will ever come into use.\n\nI liked the book, though the use of short chapters distracted from its coherence. It's a worthwhile read I'd recommend to anyone.",

Schneier explains how, with that mindset, it’s difficult to *not* see insecurities, breaks in the system, opportunities for stressing any system using its own rules against it, and the gaps where there are assumptions instead of tested security measures.\n\nThe analogies are clear and useful, the narrative is a quick read, and Schneier actually explains a method for learning how to think like a hacker. I’ll be recommending it to the people I know who want to understand how a particular mindset can both be a problem and a prerequisite for a well-paying job.\n\nDisclaimer: I read and gave comments on a prior version, but this is the beautiful finished product.

    "synopsis": "Walter Isaacson’s “enthralling” (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs.\n\nBased on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years—as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.\n\nAt a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in 21st century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.\n\nAlthough Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.\n\nDriven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.\n\nSteve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.",

        "comment": "Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:\n\n1- \"I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics,\" he said. \"Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.\" It was as if he were suggesting themes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur where both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative economies in the twenty-first century.\"\n\n2- \"His wife also did not request restrictions or control, nor did she ask to see in advance what I would publish. In fact she strongly encouraged me to be honest about his failings as well as his strengths. She is one of the smartest and most grounded people I have ever met. \"There are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy. and that's the truth,\" she told me early on. \"You shouldn't whitewash it. He's good at spin, but he also has a remarkable story, and I'd like to see that it's all told truthfully\" I leave it to the reader to assess whether I have succeeded in this mission. I'm sure there are players in this drama who will remember some of the events differently or think that I sometimes got trapped in Jobs's distortion field.\"\n\n3- \"Jobs said that his appreciation for Eichler homes instilled in him a passion for making nicely designed products for the mass market. I Jove it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn't cost much,\" he said as he pointed out the clean elegance of the houses. \"It was the original vision for Apple. That's what we tried to do with the first Mac. That's what we did with the iPod.\"\"\n\n4- \"The Blue Box adventure established a template for a partnership that would soon be born. Wozniak would be the gentle wizard coming up with a neat invention that he would have been happy just to give away. and Jobs would figure out how to make it user-friendly, put it together in a package, market it, and make a few bucks.\"\n\n5- \"Coming back to America was, for me, much more of a cultural shock than going to India. The people in the Indian countryside don't use their intellect like we do, they use their intuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world. Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion. That's had a big impact on my work.\"\n\n6- \"Jobs is a complex person, he said, and being manipulative is just the darker facet of the traits that make him successful. Wozniak would never have been that way, but as he points out, he also could never have built Apple. \"I would rather let it pass,\" he said when I pressed the point. \"It's not something I want to judge Steve by.\"\"\n\n7- \"Apple. It was a smart choice. The word instantly signaled friendliness and simplicity. It managed to be both slightly off-beat and as normal as a slice of pie. There was a whiff of counterculture, back-to-nature earthiness to it, yet nothing could be more American. And the two words together—Apple Computer—provided an amusing disjuncture. \"\n\n8- \"Jobs's father had once taught him that a drive for perfection meant caring about the craftsmanship even of the parts unseen. Jobs applied that to the layout of the circuit board inside the Apple II. He rejected the initial design because the lines were not straight enough. This passion for perfection led him to indulge his instinct to control. Most hackers and hobbyists liked to customize, modify, and jack various things into their computers. To Jobs, this was a threat to a seamless end-to-end user experience.\"\n\n9- \"Markkula would become a father figure to Jobs. Like Jobs's adoptive father, he would indulge Jobs's strong will, and like his biological father, he would end up abandoning him. \"Markkula was as much a father-son relationship as Steve ever had,\" said the venture capitalist Arthur Rock. He began to teach Jobs about marketing and sales. \"Mike really took me under his wing,\" Jobs recalled. \"His values were much aligned with mine. He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.\"\"\n\n10- \"Was Jobs's unfiltered behavior caused by a lack of emotional sensitivity? No. Almost the opposite. He was very emotionally attuned. able to read people and know their psychological strengths and vulnerabilities. He could stun an unsuspecting: victim with an emotional towel-snap, perfectly aimed. He intuitively knew when someone was faking it or truly knew something. This made him masterful at cajoling, stroking, persuading, flattering, and intimidating people.\"\n\n11- \"But even though Jobs's style could be demoralizing, it could also be oddly inspiring. It infused Apple employees with an abiding passion to create groundbreaking products and a belief that they could accomplish what seemed impossible.\"\n\n12- \"The best products, he believed, were \"whole widgets\" that were designed end-to-end, with the software closely tailored to the hardware and vice versa. This is what would distinguish the Macintosh, which had an operating system that worked only on its own hardware, from the environment that Microsoft was creating, in which its operating system could be used on hardware made by many different companies.\"\n\n13- \"Their differences in personality and character would lead them to opposite sides of what would become the fundamental divide in the digital age. Jobs was a perfectionist who craved control and indulged in the uncompromising temperament of an artist; he and Apple became the exemplars of a digital strategy that tightly integrated hardware. software, and content into a seamless package. Gates was a smart, calculating, and pragmatic analyst of business and technology; he was )pen to licensing Microsoft's operating system and software to a variety of manufacturers.\"\n\n14- \"I'll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I'll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry. There may be a few years when I'm not there, but I'U always come back. If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you've done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times. artists have to say. \"Bye. I have to go now. I'm going crazy and I'm getting out of here.\" And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently.\"\n\n15- \"Jobs sometimes avoided the truth. Helmut Sonnenfeldt once said of Henry Kissinger, \"He lies not because it's in his interest. he lies because it's in his nature.\" It was in Jobs's nature to mislead or be secretive when he felt it was warranted. But he also indulged in being brutally honest at times, telling the truths that most of us sugarcoat or suppress. Both the dissembling and the truth-telling were simply different aspects of his Nietzschean attitude that ordinary rules didn't apply to him.\"\n\n16- \"For all of his willfulness and insatiable desire to control things. Jobs was indecisive and reticent when he felt unsure about something. He craved perfection, and he was not always good at figuring out how to settle for something less. He did not like to wrestle with complexity or make accommodations. This was true in products, design, and furnishings for the house. It was also true when it came to personal for the house. It was also true when it came to personal commitments. If he knew for sure a course of action was right. he was unstoppable. But if he had doubts, he sometimes withdrew, preferring not to think about things that did not perfectly suit him.\"\n\n17- \"Ever since he left the apple commune, Jobs had defined himself and by extension Apple, as a child of the counterculture. In ads such as \"Think Different\" and \"1984,\" he positioned the Apple brand so that it reaffirmed his own rebel streak, even after he became a billionaire, and it allowed other baby boomers and their kids to do the same. \"From when I first met him as a young guy, he's had the greatest of the impact he wants his brand to have on people,\" said Clow. Very few other companies or corporate leaders—perhaps none— could have gotten away with the brilliant audacity of associating their brand with Gandhi, Einstein, Picasso, and the Dalai Lama. Jobs was able to encourage people to define themselves as anti-corporate, creative. innovative rebels simply by the computer they used. \"Steve created the only lifestyle brand in the tech industry,\" Larry Ellison said. \"There are cars people are proud to have—Porsche, Ferrari, Prius—because what I drive says something about me. People feel the same way about an Apple product.\"\n\n18- \"One of his motivating passions was to build a lasting company. At age twelve, when he got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard, he learned that a properly run company could spawn innovation far more than any single creative individual. \"I discovered that the best innovation is sometimes the company, the way you organize a company,\" he recalled. \"The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating. When I got the chance to come back to Apple, I realized that I would be useless without the company, and that's why I decided to stay and rebuild it.\"\n\n19- \"Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products. we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product defer to you. Simplicity isn't just a -visual style. It's not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. X involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it's manufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential.\"\n\n20- \"Despite his autocratic nature—he never worshiped at the altar of consensus—Jobs worked hard to foster a culture of collaboration at Apple. Many companies pride themselves on having few meetings. Jobs had many.\"\n\n21- \"\"From the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created intellectual property. If people copied or stole our software, we'd be out of business. If it weren't protected, there'd be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs. If protection of intellectual property begins to disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get Started. But there's a simpler reason: It's wrong to steal. It hurts other people. And it hurts your own character.\" He knew, however, that the best way to stop piracy—in fact the only way—was to offer an alternative that was more attractive than the brain-dead services that music companies were concocting.\"\n\n22- \"But Sony couldn't. It had pioneered portable music with the Walkman, it had a great record company, and it had a long history of making beautiful consumer devices. It had all of the assets to compete with Jobs's Strategy of integration of hardware, software, devices, and content sales. Why did it fail? Partly because it was a company, like AOL Time Warner that was organized into divisions (that word itself was ominous) with their own bottom lines; the goal of achieving synergy in such companies by prodding the divisions to work together was usually elusive. Jobs did not organize Apple into semi-autonomous divisions; he closely controlled all of his teams and pushed them to work as one cohesive and flexible company, with one profit-and-loss bottom fine. \"We don't have 'divisions' with their own P&L,\" said Tim Cook. \"We run one P&L for the company.\"\"\n\n23- \"Despite being- a denizen of the digital world, or maybe because he knew all too well its isolating potential, Jobs was a strong believer in face-to-face meetings. \"There's a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat,\" he said. \"That's crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they're doing, you say 'Wow,' and soon you're cooking up all sorts of ideas.\" So he had the Pixar building- designed to promote encounters and unplanned collaborations. \"If a building doesn't encourage that, you'll lose a lot of innovation and the magic that's sparked by serendipity,\" he said. \"So we designed the building to make people get out of their offices and mingle in the central atrium with people they might not otherwise see.\"\"\n\n24- \"Jobs insisted that Apple focus on just two or three priorities at a time. \"There is no one better at turning off the noise that is going on around him,\" Cook said. \"That allows him to focus on a few things and say no to many things. Few people are really good at that.\" In order to institutionalize the lessons that he and his team were learning. Jobs started an in-house center called Apple University. He hired Joel Podolny, who was dean of the Yale School of Management, to compile a series of case studies analyzing important decisions the company had made, including the switch to the Intel microprocessor and the decision to open the Apple Stores. Top executives spent time teaching the cases to new employees, so that the Apple style of decision making would be embedded in the culture.\"\n\n25- \"\"Steve has a particular way that he wants to run Apple, and it's the same as it was twenty years ago, which is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of closed systems.\" Schmidt later told me. \"They don't want people to be on their platform without permission. The benefits of a closed platform is control. But Google has a specific belief that open is the better approach, because it leads to more options and competition and consumer choice.\"\"\n\n26- \"The nasty edge to his personality was not necessary. It hindered him more than it helped him. But it did, at times, serve a purpose. Polite and velvety leaders, who take care to avoid bruising others, are generally not as effective at forcing change. Dozens of the colleagues whom Jobs most abused ended their litany of horror stories by saying that he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. And he created a corporation crammed with A players.\"\n\n27- \"The saga of Steve Jobs is the Silicon Valley creation myth writ large: launching a start-up in his parents' garage and building it into the world's most valuable company. He didn't invent many things outright. but he was a master at putting together ideas, art, and technology in ways that invented the feature. He designed the Mac after appreciating the power of graphical interfaces in a way that Xerox was unable to do. and he created the iPod after grasping the joy of having a thousand in your pocket in a way that Sony, which had all the assets and heritage, never could accomplish. Some leaders push innovations by being good at the big picture. Others do so by mastering details. Jobs did both, relentlessly. As a result he launched a series of products over three decades that transformed whole industries...\"\n\n28- \"Was he smart? No, not exceptionally. Instead, he was a genius. His imaginative leaps were instinctive, unexpected, and at times magical. He was, indeed, an example of what the mathematician Mark Kac called a magician genius, someone whose insights come out of the blue and require intuition more than mere mental processing power. Like a pathfinder, he could absorb information, sniff the winds, and sense what lay ahead. Steve Jobs thus became the greatest business executive of our era, the one most certain to be remembered a century from now. History will place him in the pantheon right next to Edison and Ford. More than anyone else of his time, he made products that were completely innovative, combining the power of poetry and processors. With a ferocity that could make working with him as unsettling as it was inspiring, he also built the world's most creative company. And he was able to infuse into its DNA the design sensibilities, perfectionism, and imagination that make it likely to be, even decades from now. the company that thrives best at the intersection of artistry and technology.\"",

        "comment": "I loved this book. I was never interested in Apple products. I had several college friends that became school teachers and Apple was all they could talk about. For some reason, that turned me off. I have found out recently that I was not alone in this assessment. I bought my first “IBM Compatible” computer around 1985. Over the years I had several Dell computers using Windows and Microsoft Word, Excel, Access Database, Quicken, etc. I also used this type of hardware and software at work. I had an Android phone which I hated. In 2008 I discovered the iPod. OMG, loved it. In 2019 my iPod was dead, my Canon camera was awful and I hated the Android phone. I walked in to AT&T and walked out with the iPhone XR which blew me away. Three devices in one. Great music, a great phone and a camera. In 2021 I had a Samsung Tablet that started to act up. I went for the iPad Mini. No comparison to Samsung. In 2022, my Dell desktop was 5 years old. I decided to make a huge leap and go for an iMac. The transition from Windows and Microsoft to Apple wasn’t exactly a piece of cake but, thanks to hours of YouTube Videos, I made it. I’m never going back. Three devices that all sync with each other. Documents in iCloud. If you’re an Apple user, you know what I mean. If you’re not an Apple user, you don’t know what you’re missing. So, back to this book review: it was fascinating to read about the development of all of these devices. I knew a little about Steve Jobs, but this book really goes in to the detail about his life and this company. He was a very complicated genius. He truly did change the world and Walter Isaacson did a fabulous job telling his complicated story.",

        "comment": "Many people might mistake this book for a mere biography of the man that made Apple a household name and its products coveted by millions around the world. It's not.\n\nThis book is actually three books in one. It's a business book on how to (and not to) run a company using Apple, NeXT and Pixar as case studies. It's also a history book on the ascent and the drama behind the consumer electronics evolution. And as its title suggests, it's the fascinating story of one of the most gifted people of our time.\n\nAs a business book, Isaacson writes about three distinct business practices. The first is how to really create a company from scratch. The passion exuded by Jobs and Wozniak is detailed with infectious enthusiasm in the first half of the book.\n\nThe second practice (and one often not talked about in business books) is how to drive a company to the ground. The book is rife with examples of internal politics, lack of leadership and the absence of focus that truly illustrate how companies fail.\n\nThe last practice is how to build and operate a creative company that endures. For me, this is the most fascinating narrative of all. But to fully appreciate it, one must truly understand the first two, which almost always precede this one.\n\nThe book offers a great case study of three companies: Apple, NeXT and Pixar. One fascinating vignette in the book draws a contrast between Apple and Sony and why Apple was successful in conquering the consumer-end of the music business while Sony, who was in a favorable position to do exactly that, failed to do so. This story draws attention to the importance of inter-departmental cohesion that Apple possessed and Sony didn't, to the success of innovation in a company.\n\nBusiness leaders reading this book will learn a lot about the power of \"focus\" in business. Steve Jobs's most doled out advice was \"focus.\" Throughout the book, we learn how Jobs followed his own advice to a deadly fault.\n\nAs a business book, it is amongst the best.\n\nIt's also an even better history book. It details the ascent of personal computing from the perspective of the very people that were (and still are) at its helm. The book doesn't only cover Apple's evolution, but that of the entire industry. Naturally, that involves drama, which Isaacson does a great job of covering. The philosophical divide between open and closed systems that dominated the personal computing evolution is discussed thoroughly in the book via anecdotal accounts on what really happened behind the scenes. It explains what it really took to bring us the products on which I read this book and now writing its review.\n\nMost importantly, this is a very personal book. It is the story of man adored by millions of geeks, and when departed, mourned by hundreds of millions of Apple consumers around the world. Unfortunately, a devastating portrait that is guaranteed to put out any respect or admiration you've ever had for the man emerges early on in the book. If you have spent the last fifteen years romanticizing about Steve Jobs and his products, this book will leave you punch-drunk. You will learn through stomach-churning details how Steve Jobs was a disloyal, lying, backstabbing, vindictive, manipulative, vengeful, and all-around vile and damaged human being. He was, and surprisingly so, a coward, as clearly illustrated by how he treated people in his twenties and thirties.\n\nAnd oh, he cried a lot. I mean, A LOT.\n\nThe book is rife with examples of his cruelty towards those who he seemed to have loved the most. His treatment of Steve Wozniak was unconscionable and disgusting. But the most disturbing example and the one that really shows his character was how he treated his \"soul mate\" from Reed College, Daniel Kottke. I could sum it up by quoting John Scully's wife when she told Jobs:\n\nWhen I look into most people's eyes, I see a soul. When I look into your eye, I see a bottomless pit, an empty hole, a dead zone.\n\nEven the amiable, most trusting co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, who's been backstabbed by Jobs several times, have said about Jobs, \"I look forward to a great product and I wish him success, but his integrity I cannot trust.\"\n\nThe irony in Steve Jobs story was that he loathed people that treated him the way he treated others. He had to deal with a few people that gave him a run for his money like Eisner of Disney and Katzenburg of DreamWorks. He claims throughout the book that he's \"honest\" and a \"straightshooter\" yet all the stories relayed by people that had to deal with him tell a completely different story.\n\nFor a control freak, it boggles me how he allowed such a book to be written about him. Now we all know that he might have been a visionary, but he was also a very disturbed man void of compassion, empathy and integrity.\n\nAs I got deeper into the book I started to wonder, \"did Apple offer on-campus Al-Anon meetings to its employees?\" Evidently, working for or with Steve Jobs was like being in a relationship with a recovering Cocaine addict who sees the world in black and white and throws frequent tantrums that are aimed at destroying those around them. It's what Mike Murray, Apple's Marketing Chief, called, \"management by character assassination.\"\n\nJobs quotes Bob Dylan, whom we learn early in the book was one of his heroes, \"if you're not busy being born, you're busy dying.\" It's ironic to quote those powerful words and not heed them. The book clearly shows that Steve Jobs was never really reborn or reinvented as a person. He never evolved and his base qualities were never tamed. Naturally, he spent his entire life dying from the inside out.\n\nThe book left me enriched, provoked and sad in equal measure. It is long but flows well and is a fast read. All business executives should read it for the insight it offers on what real successful companies are made of and what pitfalls to avoid along the way. Also, everyone in technology should read it to get a perspective on the evolution in the space of personal and consumer computing and to understand where we're headed and how to get there. Even if you're not an executive or a geek, you should read this book for its fascinating (and well told) story of a man from Northern California who dramatically changed how we live. A man as rich with creativity and intuition for what consumers want as he was bankrupt of decency and compassion for most of those he touched.\n\nIt's a story worth reading. If for nothing else, read it to understand what it took to create the device on which you're reading this very review.",

I'm a former data center system administrator - also called a sysadmin - and finally, here's a computer book that I can recommend to my computer illiterate friends and relatives when it comes to getting started in learning to code or to use slightly more advanced computing technologies than the average Joe user. My only gripe is that the transition from scratch game programming to python game programming involved a preliminary python for business users segment that kind of distracted from the main theme of the previous section. And then the jump to web technologies had me expecting a mention of rails, python CGI, or PHP, none of which was mentioned. Your website will look nice but have zero backend functionality. Other than that it's a good book. I recommend it for beginners in coding, and no further. For me it was just a review.",

I have purchased other \"how-to\" guides for beginners, which ended up being very confusing and required a more intermediate level of knowledge with coding. I am very happy with this book, as it provides straightforward and easy to understand lessons in four different coding languages, along with access to a free-to-use coding program so you can practice each lesson step-by-step in real time. The book is very colorful and laid out well with lots of pictures to illustrate each step in the process.

Together, we programmed our first game (Knights Quest) and as a Zelda fan, I was super into it.

They also provide a comprehensive glossary of terms, which is helpful for readers who are new to AI and chatbots.\n\nOverall, \"ChatGPT for Nonfiction Authors\" is a valuable resource for nonfiction authors who want to explore the potential of AI-powered chatbots to improve their writing process. The book is well-written, practical, and informative, and it provides a good introduction to the world of AI-powered content generation. While the book is not without its limitations, such as the fact that AI-generated content may not always be as nuanced as human-generated content, it is a valuable tool for writers who want to save time and increase their productivity.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNOTE: ***THE ABOVE REVIEW WAS GENERATED BY ChatGPT *** in response to my prompt (my request): \"Please write a 300-word summary of the book \"ChatGPT for Nonfiction Authors\" by Hassan Osman and ChatGPT. Include a discussion of the methodology and an evaluation of the resulting book.\"\n\nAfter it generated the review I copied and pasted above, I then asked ChatGPT to \"regenerate\" its response. (That's sort of like asking your friend to describe his vacation, then asking him the same question a week or two later. You're going to get two different responses.)\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT to regenerate its response, it came up with the following, which I prefer to its first response:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\"ChatGPT for Nonfiction Authors\" is a guidebook co-written by ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, and Hassan Osman, an author and project manager. The book is aimed at nonfiction authors who want to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) language models, specifically ChatGPT, into their writing process.\n\nThe book begins by providing an overview of AI and natural language processing, explaining how ChatGPT works and its capabilities. The authors then describe how authors can use ChatGPT to generate ideas, outline their books, and even co-write with the language model. The book also includes practical tips on how to fine-tune ChatGPT's responses and integrate them seamlessly into the author's work.\n\nOne of the strengths of the book is its step-by-step methodology. The authors provide clear instructions on how to use ChatGPT effectively, from setting up an account to training the model to respond in a specific way. They also include examples of how other authors have used ChatGPT, giving readers a sense of the possibilities available to them.\n\nAnother strength of the book is its emphasis on collaboration between the author and ChatGPT. The authors stress that ChatGPT is not a replacement for human creativity and input, but rather a tool to enhance it. They provide examples of how authors can work with ChatGPT to generate ideas and refine their writing, while still maintaining their own unique voice and perspective.\n\nOverall, \"ChatGPT for Nonfiction Authors\" is a valuable resource for authors interested in incorporating AI language models into their writing process. The book provides clear and practical guidance on how to use ChatGPT effectively, while also emphasizing the importance of human creativity and collaboration. While the book is specific to ChatGPT, the methodology outlined can be applied to other AI language models as well.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is ME writing now: One thing that quickly jumped out at me was that ChatGPT definitely DOES have a \"voice\" or style. I would call it \"MONOTONE/DULL/UNIMAGINATIVE.\"\n\nI'm glad Osman didn't try to change the style, because I received an insight into one of the robot's limitations. I'd say that captivating writing is to ChatGPT as Vincent van Gogh is to Paint-by-Numbers. One is exciting, while the other is rather boring.\n\nAnd THAT is where you, as an author, can use your talents to spiff up and re-write the model's output. You can do your own \"regenerate\" to take the robot's ideas and shape them with your own inimitable style.\n\nFinally, here's one more demonstration of the capability of ChatGPT: I didn't see a log-off button on the interface, so I decided to ask ChatGPT, itself, how to log off the system. I gave it this prompt: \"When I am finished experimenting with ChatGPT for the day, how do I log off the system? I want to free up my resources for other users.\"\n\nHere's it's response. Not too bad for a robot!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs an AI language model, ChatGPT doesn't require any specific log off procedure. You can simply exit the application or close the browser window that you're using to access it.\n\nHowever, if you're using a cloud-based service to access ChatGPT, it's a good idea to make sure that you're not still actively running any processes that are using resources. You can do this by checking the task manager or activity monitor on your computer to see if any processes related to ChatGPT are still running.\n\nIf you're using a shared resource or a cloud-based service, it's important to be mindful of other users and to follow any guidelines or policies set by the service provider. Some providers may have specific log off procedures or usage limits to ensure that resources are available for all users. If you're unsure of the specific policies, you may want to reach out to the service provider for more information.",

        "comment": "\"ChatGPT for Nonfiction Authors: How to Use ChatGPT to Write Better, Faster, and More Effectively\" is a valuable resource for writers looking to incorporate AI technology into their writing process. The book offers practical tips and techniques on how to use ChatGPT effectively, including clear explanations and examples to help writers apply the concepts to their own work.\n\nWhile I was already familiar with some of the tips presented in the book as a ChatGPT user, I still found the advanced techniques to be helpful. The author breaks down complex concepts into easy-to-understand steps, making it accessible for writers of all skill levels.\n\nOne potential concern is that ChatGPT has a recognizable style that may not fit with every writer's voice. However, the book does not go into detail about this point, so writers should be aware of this potential issue.\n\nOverall, I would recommend \"ChatGPT for Nonfiction Authors\" to anyone looking to improve their writing with the help of AI technology.

Reading it will not make you and expert on ChatGPT. It will be a good barometer on understanding what you don’t know and what you need to learn first to begin using it effectively and ethically. ChatGPT is only a tool, but one that is very effective when used smartly. Each of us brings our own expertise to what we do as writers. What we have here is a tool that can streamline the writing process form start to finish. It will not replace us as writers…yet.

        "comment": "My social media has a lot of programmers and authors, so I've been hearing a lot lately about ChatGPT. There's a lot of concern - particularly from illustrators - about losing work to artificial intelligence. The fear of being replaced by technology isn't new, but it's only recently that technology has advanced to the point where a computer can do a competent job at writing and illustrating.\n\nI tried out ChatGPT myself by asking it a couple of simple programming questions, and was honestly impressed by its responses. So when I heard that Hassan was using it to write a book, my curiosity was definitely piqued.\n\nSo how was the book? I found it competent but not exciting. It was easy to read and understand, but after the introduction there wasn't much of an author's voice. I got an idea of how to interact with the software, but I'm still unsure of the extent of its capabilities.\n\nOverall, I think there are a lot of legal and ethical questions that need to be answered about claiming ownership of AI-created works, and I foresee a lot of people trying to jump in and crank out books without having the expertise to correct the AI's mistakes, thus causing issues for legitimate authors. That said, while I wouldn't use AI-generated text in my own books, I can also see the use of ChatGPT as a research tool, helping to generate ideas and find information so that the author can concentrate on writing.",

But the gentlemen who wrote this book knew what he was doing and even worded the questions as they are on thr actual exam. There really hard questions to. So be prepared for red hearings and trick questions. There are no simple questions on the current sec+ exam.The sec+ exam essentially gives you 4 right answers and you have to pick what fits the context and what is the most practical. So hone your critical thinking skills. Because this book helps GUIDE you in that direction. I passed because of this and Jason dion on udemy. Good stuff. Be familiar with the concept with examples.

        "comment": "Honestly, CompTIA tests suck. They have such a big range of questions, and 3rd-party study guides won't cover all the details of every topic.\n\nI passed the SY0-601 using a combination of 3 different guides, and NONE of them by itself was enough to pass the test. In fact, all 3 combined only covered about 95% of my test questions. I literally checked the study guides afterwards for the material I remember seeing on the test, and some of them weren't ever discussed. It was ridiculous.\n\nDarril Gibson's test will get you through 80% of the test, which is pretty good. I like how it was easy to read and engaging. Messer's will get you through 90% of the test, but I fell asleep through his material so many times.\n\nYou'll want to score about 90% on the practice tests for both Gibson and Messer's guides to pass the CompTIA Sec+ exam.",

    "synopsis": "The inspiring, long-awaited autobiography of video game designer and DOOM cocreator John Romero\n\nJohn Romero, gaming’s original rock star, is the cocreator of DOOM, Quake, and Wolfenstein 3-D, some of the biggest video games of all time. Considered the godfather of the first- person shooter, a genre that continues to dominate the market today, he holds a unique place in gaming history. In DOOM Guy: Life in First Person, Romero chronicles, for the first time, his difficult childhood and storied career, beginning with his early days submitting Apple II game code to computer magazines and sneaking computers out the back door of his day job to write code at night.\n        \nIndustry-redefining breakthroughs in design and tech during Romero’s time at id Software made DOOM and Quake cultural phenomena, and this thrilling story recounts every step of the process, from collaborative, heavy metal–fueled days spent crafting the industry’s most revolutionary and cutting-edge games to a high-profile falling-out with id cofounder John Carmack. After years in the gaming spotlight, Romero is now telling his story—the whole story—shedding new light on the development of his games and his business partnerships, from the highest highs to the lowest lows, sharing insights about design, code, the industry, and his career right up to today. Sharing gratitude for a lifetime in games, Romero reveals the twists and turns that led him, ultimately, to be called DOOM Guy.",

        "comment": "John Romero was involved in not only one of the most important eras of PC gaming, but one of the most important eras of technology overall. The early 1990s to early 2000s contained innovations such as 3D graphics, processors which broke the 1ghz barrier, networking at its initial burst onto the scene, standards in sound cards, and much more. John was in the trenches during all of that, and thus he had an intimate experience with it all. His story reflects the time period and his numerous undertakings.\n\nThe book obviously is a must for anyone that's a fan of id Software, Doom, Quake, Ion Storm, and so on; however, John touches upon a number of other topics, such as his upbringing which helps to better visualize his later path in life, early efforts at Sierra College, Pac-Man, working at Origin, the shareware scene, Microsoft's drive with Windows 95, Nine Inch Nails, 3D Realms, Raven Software, early efforts at mobile titles, World of Warcraft, Buckethead, crowdfunding issues, and so on. It's also undeniable that a good chunk of John's history was told through the media and journalists, thus many of the stories are familiar to long-time fans, but hearing them directly from John puts most of the scenarios in a whole new light.\n\nIn regards to the chronology of John's life and career, he touches upon nearly every step of the way. The more pivotal moments such as his first attempts at programming and id Software's founding rightfully has the most context. There's very few faults in the book overall. A few statements are a bit off the mark in the factual scheme of things, such as Quake being the first to popularize mouse-look (it was actually The Terminator: Future Shock) and Dominion not getting any positive reviews (a quick glance turned up at least two from high profile publications), but they're too inane and scattered to deter from the book. In regards to John's attitude throughout the whole book, he clearly shows his self-awareness as he honestly evaluates his past failures, treasures his upbeat optimistic moments, and discusses his overall outcomes.\n\nJohn's book is a reflection of not only his path in life, but of a superb time in history, and the fact that he was so closely involved in that timeframe is a sensible enough reason to pickup the book.",

        "comment": "As a Doom fan myself, when I learned that John Romero was writing his autobiography, I knew I had to pick up a copy. However, given that David Kushner's Masters of Doom is one of my personal favorite books, I was unsure what additional details Doom Guy would bring. Indeed, some of the stories John tells here are rehashed from Kushner's masterpiece, but there is so much more that Romero reveals in this book.\n\nJohn starts out describing his early life with great detail, and we finally get a glimpse into his background, and how it led to his passion for making games. We get far greater detail than the several pages Kushner dedicated to John's origin story. Romero then goes on to telling the story of his early game industry days before arriving at Softdisk.\n\nFor readers familiar with Masters of Doom, the chapters dedicated to the Softdisk and id Software days cover many of the same stories as in Kushner's work, but there is still a great level of context John adds to the story. In fact, on several occasions Romero corrects the record on some inaccuracies or conflated stories that have previously been widely reported. He puts much more detail on the design of Quake, and explains all the work he did to deliver products such as the Master Levels and Final Doom. He also brings a very different perspective and set of facts about his eventual split with id compared to the usual hostile portrayal of \"Romero versus Carmack.\"\n\nRomero's telling of Ion Storm seems shorter than Kushner's, but John includes a lot of extra context and you get a real sense of the lessons he learned from its demise. Romero then wraps everything up with a few chapters detailing his post-Ion Storm life up to the present day, including his creation of SIGIL.\n\nIf you've read Masters of Doom, this book will still provide a lot of extra context and is very complementary. If not, you'll still get a great story with all the key events told in excellent detail.",

Hearing his version of events from the first 6 years of id Software's history transported me back to my teenage years and my cherished memories of the countless hours spent playing Keen, Wolf, Doom, and Quake. I especially appreciated his honesty and vulnerability in sharing the story of his firing, and his rollercoaster ride of emotions at Ion Storm. Thank you, John, for sharing your inspiring life with the world! I've been a huge fan of your work for the past 30 years, and I can't wait to see what new games you create next!",

Listening how he grew up dirt poor and suffered abuse, to helping form id software and writing several of my favorite PC games with Doom, Doom 2, and Quake was amazing. It was sad to read again about it falling apart at id, and the collapse of Ion Storm. Glad he is still making games, and enjoying time with his family. Still a hero of mine from the earlier PC days, and glad to have finally read his story from his point of view.",

    "synopsis": "Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords?\n\nIn this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.\n\nPeer under the hood of the systems you already use, and learn how to use and operate them more effectively\nMake informed decisions by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different tools\nNavigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity\nUnderstand the distributed systems research upon which modern databases are built\nPeek behind the scenes of major online services, and learn from their architectures",

        "comment": "Kleppmann mentioned during his \"Turning the Database Inside Out with Apache Samza\" talk at Strange Loop 2014 (see my notes) that he was on sabbatical working on this book, and while waiting quite some time for it to be published, I ended up experimenting with his Bottled Water project as well as Apache Kafka (which was only at release 0.8.2.2 at that point in time). Other reviewers are correct that much of the material included in this book is available elsewhere, but this book is packaged well (although still at 550-pages and heavyweight), with most of the key topics associated with data-intensive applications under one roof with good explanations and numerous footnotes which point to resources providing additional detail.\n\nContent is broken down into 3 sections and 12 chapters: (1) foundations of data systems, which covers reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications, data models and query languages, storage and retrieval, and encoding and evolution, (2) distributed data, which covers replication, partitioning, transactions, the trouble with distributed systems, and consistency and consensus, and (3) derived data, which covers batch processing, stream processing, and the future of data systems. The latter 6 chapters are weighted more heavily, with chapter 9 on consistency and consensus, and chapter 12 on the future of data systems, the most lengthy with each comprising about 12% of the book.\n\nSome potential readers might be disappointed that this book is all theory, but while the author does not provide any code he discusses practical implementation and specific details when applicable for comparisons within a product category. In my opinion, the last chapter is probably the most abstract simply because it explores ideas about how the tools covered in the prior two chapters might be used in the future to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. Similiary, the chapter on the opposite end of this book sets the stage well for any developer of nontrivial applications with its section on thinking about database systems and the concerns around reliability, scalability, and maintainability.\n\nAbout a year ago, I recall an executive colleague responding to me with a quizzical look when I mentioned that tooling for data and application development is converging over time, and just a few months prior I mentioned in a presentation to developers that transactional and analytical capabilities are being provided more and more by single database products, with one executive in the audience shaking his head in disagreement that kappa rather than lambda architectures are the way to go. Kleppman mentions that we typically think of databases, message brokers, caches, etc as residing in very different categories of tooling because each of these has very different access patterns, meaning different performance characteristics and therefore different implementations.\n\nSo why should all of this tooling not be lumped together under an umbrella term such as 'data systems'? Many products for data storage and processing have emerged in recent years, optimized for a variety of use cases and no longer neatly fitting into traditional categories: the boundaries between categories are simply becoming blurred, and since a single tool can no longer satisfy the data processing and storage needs for many applications, work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single system that is often comprised of different tooling stitched together by application code under the covers.\n\nIn addition to the author's abundant and effective simple line diagrams that are reminiscent (although more sophisticated) of his earlier diagrams, one aspect that I especially appreciate is the nomenclature comparisons between products when walking through terminology. For example, at the beginning of chapter 6, the author specifically calls out the terminological confusion that exists with respect to partitioning. \"What we call a 'partition' here is called a 'shard' in MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and SolrCloud; it's known as a 'region' in HBase, a 'tablet' in Bigtable, a 'vnode' in Cassandra and Riak, and a 'vBucket' in Couchbase. However, partitioning is the most established term, so we'll stick to that.\"\n\nIn addition, Kleppmann walks through differences between products when the same terminology is being used, which can also lead to confusion. For example, in chapter 7 the author provides a great 5-page discussion on the meaning of \"ACID\" (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability), which was an effective reminder to me that while this term was coined in 1983 in an effort to establish precise terminology for fault-tolerance mechanisms in databases, in practice one database's implementation of ACID does not equal another's implementation. \"Today, when a system claims to be 'ACID compliant', it's unclear what guarantees you can actually expect. ACID has unfortunately become mostly a marketing term.\"\n\nIf you've ever found yourself confused about the concept of \"consistency\", the author offers a sanity check that your confusion is warranted, not only because the term is \"terribly overloaded\" with at least four different meanings, but because \"the letter C doesn't really belong in ACID\" since it was \"tossed in to make the acronym work\" in the original paper, and that \"it wasn't considered important at the time.\" The reality is that \"atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency (in the ACID sense) is a property of the application. The application may rely on the database's atomicity and isolation properties in order to achieve consistency, but it's not up to the database alone.\"\n\nAn later in chapter 9 where he discusses consistency and consensus, the author provides a great sidebar on \"the unhelpful CAP theorem\". As Kleppmann later comments, \"the CAP theorem as formally defined is of very narrow scope: it only considers one consistency model (namely linearizability) and one kind of fault (network partitions, or nodes that are alive but disconnected from each other). It doesn't say anything about network delays, dead nodes, or other trade-offs. Thus, although CAP has been historically influential, it has little practical value for designing systems.\"\n\nThe author concludes in a sidebar by commenting that \"all in all, there is a lot of misunderstanding and confusion around CAP, and it does not help us understand systems better, so CAP is best avoided.\" This is because \"CAP is sometimes presented as 'Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance: pick 2 out of 3'. Unfortunately, putting it this way is misleading because network partitions are a kind of fault, so they aren't something about which you have a choice: they will happen whether you like it or not...A better way of phrasing CAP would be 'either Consistent or Available when Partitioned'. A more reliable network needs to make this choice less often, but at some point the choice is inevitable.\"\n\nWhile the second section of this text on distributed data was most beneficial to me, the third section on derived data was least beneficial, mainly because I'm already familiar with these topics from recent readings and experience, and because I needed to refamiliarize myself with the content discussed in the second section. However, the author presents derived data well, and I certainly do not recommend skipping this section. As Kleppmann comments, the issues around integrating multiple different data systems into one coherent application architecture is often overlooked by vendors who claim that their product can satisfy all of your needs. In reality, integrating disparate systems (which can be grouped into the two broad categories of \"systems of record\" and \"derived data systems\") is one of the most important things that needs to be done in a nontrivial application. I highly recommend this text.",

        "comment": "Designing Data-Intensive Applications really exceeded my expectations. Even if you are experienced in this area this book will re-enforce things you know (or sort of know) and bring to light new ways of thinking about solving distributed systems and data problems. It will give you a solid understanding of how to choose the right tech for different use cases.\n\nThe book really pulls you in with an intro that is more high level, but mentions problems and solutions that really anyone who has worked on these types of applications have either encountered or heard mention of. The promise it makes is to take these issues such as scalability, maintainability and durability and explain how to decide on the right solutions to these issues for the problems you are solving. It does an amazing job of that throughout the book.\n\nThis book covers a lot, but at the same time it knows exactly when to go deep on a subject. Right when it seems like it may be going too deep on things like how different types of databases are implemented (SSTables, B-trees, etc.) or on comparing different consensus algorithms, it is quick to point out how and why those things are important to practical real-world problems and how understanding those things is actually vital to the success of a system.\n\nAlong those same lines it is excellent at circling back to concepts introduced at prior points in the book. For example the book goes into how log based storage is used for some databases as their core way of storing data and for durability in other cases. Later in the book when getting into different message/eventing systems such as Kafka and ActiveMQ things swing back to how these systems utilize log based storage in similar ways. Even if you have prior knowledge or even have worked with these technologies, how and why they work and the pros and cons of each become crystal clear and really solidified. Same can be said of it's great explanations of things like ZooKeeper and why specific solutions like Kafka make use of it.\n\nThis book is also amazing at shedding light on the fact that so little of what is out there is totally new, it attempts to go back as far as it can at times on where a certain technology's ideas originated (back to the 1800s at some points!). Bringing in this history really gives a lot of context around the original problems that were being solved, which in turn helps understanding pros and cons. One example is the way it goes through the history of batch processing systems and HDFS. The author starts with MapReduce and relating it to tech that was developed decades before. This really clarifies how we got from batch processing systems on proprietary hardware to things like MapReduce on commodity hardware thanks in part to HDFS, eventually to stream based processing. It also does great at explaining the pros and cons of each and when one might choose one technology over the other.\n\nThat's really the theme of this book, teaching the reader how to compare and contrast different technologies for solving distributed systems and data problems. It teaches you to read between the lines on how certain technologies work so that you can identify the pros and cons early and without needing them to be spelled out by the authors of those technologies. When thinking about databases it teaches you to really consider the durability/scalability model and how things are no where near black and white between \"consistent\" vs \"eventually consistent\", these is a ton of nuance there and it goes deep on things like single vs multi leader vs leaderless, linearizability, total order broadcast, and different consensus algorithms.\n\nI could go on forever about this book. To name a few other things it touches on to get a good idea of the breadth here: networking (and networking faults), OLAP, OLTP, 2 phase locking, graph databases, 2 phase commit, data encoding, general fault tolerance, compatibility, message passing, everything I mentioned above, and the list goes on and on and on. I recommend anyone who does any kind of work with these systems takes the time to read this book. All 600ish pages are worth reading, and it's presented in an excellent, engaging way with real world practical examples for everything.",

        "comment": "In a PM library, Teresa's CDH book should rank #2 on the most-wanted list (Marty Cagan's Inspired is #1).\nGiven the vastly increasing set of resources and books in the PM space, this is indeed a bold statement but IMO, this is well deserved.\n\nAs a PM practitioner, I'm grateful that such an important topic (product discovery!) has met such a brilliant, structured, and systematic mind in Teresa. The book is comprehensive on the topic, starting with history, then foundational principles, and delving into all the practical aspects of practice. Teresa’s clarity of thought gives her writing perfect nuance, and the content is never over-stated nor does she make any overly broad sweeping claims.\n\nWhat makes her advice in the book so powerful is that the book is built on years / decades of practice. She is not just a teacher, but a coach - who in real life helps product teams across industries / companies / company stages & sizes implement these principles daily. This makes her advice very practical and pragmatic - just what you need to start making wins in your workplace tomorrow, while over time winning converts to a better way of working.\n\nThis is a book for the entire product team, especially the product trio i.e., the product manager, designer, and technical lead. I have already made improvements in the way we approach product discovery, and my team loves me for it!\n\nI also enjoyed the audio-book as well, which was narrated by Teresa herself. Did not skip a second, and re-listened to many sections. Great investment!\n\nTo people like Teresa (& Marty), I have only 2 things to say: Thank you, and I wonder what you will write about next?",

        "comment": "I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in realizing our own agency and how we can influence team dynamics in a product company.\n\nThe book introduces many practical artifacts to help the team align and prioritize resources. One of these artifacts is the Opportunity Solution Tree (OST), which starts with business outcomes followed by opportunities based on user needs. It's important to note that there is a lot of content to learn how to go from outputs to outcomes.\n\nThe book includes relevant diagrams to illustrate the framework, demonstrating one of the points Teresa makes throughout the book about the power of visualization for teamwork. Here are some of the concepts explained in the book:\n\n- Product trio (Product Manager, Designer, Software Engineer)\n- Experience Maps\n- Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)\n- Interview Snapshot and Story Maps\n\nTeresa recommends starting at an individual level first to avoid group thinking when creating experience maps. This is a great way to leverage diversity of thought. The best part is that Teresa not only recommends this approach at the beginning of collaboration but continuously as part of the discovery habits to keep take advantage of a diverse team. I think this is really important in order to create products that take into account many more scenarios and minorities that are usually overlooked.\n\nAnother great point that I noticed in this book, is the addition of ethical assumptions in the types of assumptions to test. In the book, Teresa explains how to test these assumptions and includes examples. This subject can not be more relevant today when users are becoming more aware of privacy concerns and lack of transparency on the products we use every day.\n\nLastly, each chapter of the book features an \"anti-pattern\" section where Teresa lays out problems you might run into when implementing her framework.\n\nAs you can see, it's all about practice. However, Teresa makes an emphasis that is all about the right mindset.",

        "comment": "What is this book? A treaty? A compendium? An impassioned plea? Or a sales pitch drawing its unique proposition from philosophy, history, and humanities littered with revelations of opportunities and doom?\n\nIt is everything, and more.\n\nAs of writing, GPT-4 is the rave in artificial intelligence (AI). But the world has already had intimations of AI's power through its predecessors, particularly ChatGPT. In a deluge of information, it is necessary to have a voice of authority and wisdom to explain the phenomenon we face. This book fits the bill as a pamphlet that conceptually explains what AI is, without the technicalities that may baffle non-technical readers. (I have enjoyed an interview between one of the authors, Eric Schmidt and Alexandr Wang, on the subject, which inspired my purchase of the book).\n\nAs a compendium, the book catalogues the development in computing and situates modern AI as the culmination of years of progress. It posits that we have created a thing with processing power that outstrips human cognition and can capture aspects of reality beyond human detection. AI can now beat us, quite literally, at our own game, as seen in chess, where an AI trained on the rules of the game augments itself to make independent and more compelling moves beyond human comprehension. Similarly, AI can discover new antibiotics in record time by merely being exposed to fundamental principles. Chess and medical breakthroughs are frequent references in the book, demonstrating the extent to which AI would affect domains once reserved for humans.\n\nChapter 2 is particularly delightful, with sentences brimming with such verve that one wishes it never ends. It explores centuries of sociocultural and sociopolitical forces that paved the way for AI and pranced through the evolution of human ingenuity, reason, and intellect. The chapter posits that AI's ability to upend every aspect of society surpasses the revolutions wrought by the printing press and electricity. These earlier technologies not only introduced new forms; they disrupted every aspect of society. The printing press bestowed new roles on the Western individual by wresting powers away from the Church and equipping the individual - facilitated by the Protestant agitations - with scholarly access to the divine. This psychological shift in the Western mind - sufficiently explored in Joseph Henrich's work, The Weirdest People in the World - launched the Renaissance, ushering in flourishing in arts, architecture, literature, and civic participation, ensuring the greatness of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and others. The authors contend that AI is destined to follow a similar trajectory.\n\nThe philosophical underpinnings of AI are captivating. The authors, probing AI's capture of reality, align it with Wittgenstein's view of making meaning through familiar connections rather than reducing reality to mechanistic explanations. Hence, the neural networks that inspire AI in mimicking the structure of the human brain place it far from mere computations of cause and effect, or garbage in, garbage out.\n\n“To enable machine learning, what mattered was the overlap between various representations of a thing, not its ideal — in philosophical terms, Wittgenstein, not Plato. The modern field of machine learning — of programs that learn through experience — was born.”\n\nStill, on philosophy, the book wonders if we are equipped to deal with our new fate. If AI can capture reality outside human conception, how do we retain our identity when perceptions would be determined by something beyond us? The authors concede that civilisation has been primarily created and sustained through the dynamics of Faith and Reason, and AI is designing a new form. It is a difficult notion to digest, since phenomena that thinkers and philosophers have grappled with, e.g., consciousness, divinity, nature/nurture, would become more challenging to comprehend.\n\nThere is a lot of caution in the book. The authors warn that where nuclear weapon is the most dreadful of human arsenals, AI surpasses it by an order of magnitude. This apocalyptic view is further compounded by the difficulty of designing effective verification systems for a rather inscrutable technology. It is to wonder what we have gotten ourselves into. Human ingenuity has birthed a hybrid of saint and devil. Where nuclear weapon is under international regulations in which nations with nuclear capabilities are under the watchful eyes of post-WWII and post-Soviet accords, how do we police something so insanely hard to detect, easily distributed, and accessible? Nuclear deterrence has so far saved us from annihilation. How do we protect ourselves from something that possesses the capacity to \"transform conventional, nuclear, and cyber weapons strategy\"? This makes the book an entreaty, inviting governments, policy wonks, and military thinkers to convene and hash out red lines that would ensure responsible applications.\n\nFor me, the positives outweigh the negatives if regulations are in place. And we must be careful to avoid stifling innovation under the guise of potential misuse. Moreover, as AI accelerates prosperity and instigates breakthroughs, how will it impact the global south? Will it leave a section of humanity behind while perpetuating historical patterns of economic inequities, a fact that Emad Mostaque of Stability AI has been vocal about? The book hints at it, but it would take a separate publication to articulate this concern.\n\nOverall, it is a delightful book written by those who should write about AI and society.",

        "comment": "Public fascination with artificial intelligence (AI) has only increased since this book was published in 2021. AI technologies, such as Chat GPT, have entered mainstream society and are being used in everyday business work. Publicly, however, leaders from philosophy, business, and government do not appear yet ready to grapple with the deep human questions involved. For example, when do we defer to AI bots over human agency? Are we ready for AI tools of war – both offensively and defensively? How will this affect how we view ourselves as creatures of reason? In this book, Henry Kissinger, a dean at MIT Daniel Huttenlocher, and the CEO of Google Eric Schmidt grapple with similar issues at length.\n\nThe depth of thought in this work cannot be contained in a short book review. Needless to say, they cover the foreseeable issues through a historical lens. AI technology seems to portend an epochal transition in human civilization, much like the advent of the printing press. A big distinction is between assistive AI, under human direction, and autonomous AI, which directs us. Also in this realm, the prospect of artificial general intelligence – that is, a sentient computer or android – looms large and frighteningly realistic.\n\nAI can apply to many fields of human activity, like the military, healthcare, business, education, and scientific research. These examples and more are explicitly examined throughout this book. Not all are good, however. The prospect of AI weapons scares me deeply. United States policy is not to develop autonomous weapons, but what about other countries? Is there any plausible way to defend against such war? It seems inevitable that someone is going to try using such a weapon eventually, even if they are a rogue terrorist group. Do we have to go through another World War I to learn our lesson?\n\nThis book offers more intelligent questions than firm answers, and that is the authors’ apparent intention. We are at the early stages of mainstream adoption of this technology, and questions abound while certainty is scarce. As such, reading this socially focused book behooves anyone interested in seriously forecasting the repercussions on the world. I develop software for a living, on the micro-level, so a treatment like this on the macro-level is helpful to see coding’s impact down the road. My experience tells me that the issues raised are spot-on, and the treatment is even and balanced. As humans, are we ready for this? No, but reading this book will make a reader more prepared.",

Each chapter covered the history of that particular topic and then gave examples of society's current directions. There was never any follow up on directions that technology should or should not be doing, no solutions. The authors are very smart persons and it was disappointing to just be getting a review on the direction that technology and society has taken through the centuries. Some of the historical examples were interesting. They gave opinions with those historical moments. Not at the end of the chapter. No opinion or solutions to foreseeable problems.\n\nWhat would be the best solution is to have a large group of persons that have experience with AI and other electrical technology such as the one already in place. This type of group is fully capable of making AI compatible with current technology in the countries they also represent. This is what a consortium has been doing with the internet and other technology: electric standards, radio standards, communications standards, the internet standards and now AI. No mention of this or IT Security. No Green ideas like have many people submitting to the electrical grid with the power they produce from solar and wind. Ideas like this are common now in the news. The authors wrote this before Ukraine in 2022 but there is an example of AI in warfare.\n\nI am disappointment that these exceptional talented persons did not give examples of solutions that have been and are in use. No cautions about putting power and water on the internet. They currently should not be. They are not even upgrading software in those areas that is how important that is.",

    "synopsis": "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER\n\nImpromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI, written by Reid Hoffman with GPT-4, offers readers a travelog of the future – exploring how AI, and especially Large Language Models like GPT-4, can elevate humanity across key areas like education, business, and creativity.\n\nBut, it's not just a book, it's a conversation. In a first, Hoffman doesn’t just write about GPT-4; he interacts and writes with GPT-4, letting readers see the technology’s capabilities — its strengths and limitations alike. Using GPT-4 as his “author’s co-pilot,” Hoffman paints an intriguing, challenging, and often entertaining picture of what’s possible: where trouble may arise, but also crucially, what could possibly go right. His conversation with AI takes us on a journey to the future, where AI is not a threat, but a partner. A partner that can help us unlock our full potential as human beings.\n\nHow might humanity use GPT-4 to continue our long-standing quest to make life more meaningful and prosperous? How can we use it to help solve some of the hardest challenges we face? To expand opportunities for self-determination and self-expression?\n\nAlong with solutions and opportunities, GPT-4 will also create its own challenges and uncertainties. Impromptu explores how we might address risk as we continue to develop AI technologies that can boost human progress at a time when the need for rapid solutions at scale has never been greater. Impromptu starts the conversation, and invites us to join that conversation to shape our collaborative journey and achieve our destiny.",

        "comment": "Whether it is literature written by ChatGPT, artwork produced by DALL-E or Midjourney, or music created by Jukebox, Artificial Intelligence and its impact on society are one of the latest hot topics in technology circles. It is not uncommon to hear people discussing the potential impact of AI on the employment ecosystem, whether AIs and their usage should be regulated, or even outlawed, and whether the adoption of AI will lead to mass unemployment as humans find their jobs supplanted by these technological marvels. In Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI, Reid Hoffman attempts to explore and answer – with the help of AI itself – these and other questions facing the future of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhile the book gives GPT-4 (the successor to GPT-3.5, on which ChatGPT is based) a partial authorship credit, this seems to be less in recognition of true authorship and perhaps slightly more of a gimmick to invite attention. Some of the contributions of GPT-4 to the narrative of the book are somewhat predictable and not revelatory in the manner that I had hoped. Using AI to perform instead what often seems like basic research, or to only offer support to the arguments being made by the human author, is a reasonable way to approach writing this book, but allowing the AI to provide insightful commentary not suggested by the human author would have made for a more engaging journey. Many of the conversations contained in the book with GPT-4 are simply the author dictating a particular response – some of the details are left up to the AI, and its responses are still interesting and insightful, but, for the most part, these exchanges seem preplanned rather than spontaneous. Or, put another way, it is like a craftsman using a tool, rather than a collaboration of peer minds. In this manner, the book fails to meet the highest expectations of AI taking a fully active role in writing the book.\n\nThat said, Hoffman does a good job of exploring many of the facets of AI and hurdles facing the widespread adoption of AI-based systems in general in a variety of different fields, from education to journalism to justice and equality among the disenfranchised, among other topics. Together with GPT-4, he tackles topics such as the tendency for current AI technologies to “get it wrong” and how the usage of these technologies might change the landscapes of the fields they are used in. He also touches on the potential impact of “bad actors” who might misuse AI technologies in the future, and some of the things we might potentially do to help prevent those outcomes. These musings are obviously very speculative, but they make for entertaining speculation and keep the book engaging.\n\nWhile this book might not cover significant new ground for those actively following the development of AI technologies, it remains an interesting look at the burgeoning field, and provides a good background and engaging exploration of the topic for the more casual observer. Hoffman’s technology background and exposure to several AI-related enterprises (he serves on the boards and/or has funded several) have equipped him to speak authoritatively and intelligently about the topic. Overall, the book is an enjoyable exploration of the landscape of AI today, and its flawless editing earning it a rating of 4 out of 5. Despite, in my opinion, falling short in integrating AI as a full-fledged co-author, it is definitely recommended reading.",

        "comment": "This book caused me to think more about the versatile use of AI across many careers and social groups. The information diminished some of the negativity and fears, but also raised a higher recognition for the need of regulation and intentional management of this technology versus it managing us. I recommend this book for those, like me, who are interested in AI, but are concerned about its uses and impact on humanity. Though it’s sometimes challenging to get beyond the run on sentences, it’s written for the layman to learn more about AI and manage our fears. I’m more willing to test drive LLMs like GPT-4 for various circumstances. However, I’m hopeful, with proper management we can close the gap of the admitted shortcomings the book outlines. It’s my hope we can move into the optimistic, progressive future Reid Hoffman projects with this tool.",

In this book the author separates fantasy from reality when discussing the issues related to artificial intelligence (AI) . Reid Hoffman is very knowledgeable on the issues surrounding AI and it’s potential for enhancing human society and the environment we live in with our fellow organisms. Yes Hoffman did write this book with GPT-4 the next iteration of ChatGPT and that is a little unoriginal these days but it helps the reader with the comprehension of what AI is and what it is not. Of course things are moving quickly and by his own admission this book is probably already out of date. There is a great deal of hype and paranoia about AI, this book provides a more realistic and optimistic view of our future.",

Like civilization, play requires structure and participants willing to create within limits. Starting with Plato, Huizinga traces the contribution of Homo Ludens, or “man the player” through Medieval Times, the Renaissance, and into our modern civilization. Huizinga defines play against a rich theoretical background, using cross-cultural examples from the humanities, business, and politics. Homo Ludens defines play for generations to come.",

It's something that is often done for its own purpose, in a dedicated place, with roles and rules that participants must observe.\n\nAccording to the author, the play element can be found in things such as War (except in modern times), Poetry, Law (the ritualistic aspect of courtrooms and the different roles of their participants), Dance, Music, Religion, Mythology and Language.\n\nPlay has strong presence of aesthetic order, repetition and alternation; it's rule-based and it precedes culture and civilization, and in fact helps establish those two things.\n\nThis is a curious book, on a somewhat peculiar topic, written by a great scholar and with some references to the difficulties of the historical moment when it was written (Western Europe in the 1930s) and it feels odd and old at times but it's fascinating all the same.",

        "comment": "In Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga makes the case that the ability and appetite for play is a defining characteristic of humanity. Huizinga describes play as an essential pillar of civilization, present in our art, our law, and even in our war. He writes about the idea of play playfully, looking for common themes in the many meanings embedded in the concept of play, rather than restricting himself to a single definition. The fluidity of play, as Huizinga sees it, allows it to course through theater, gambling and politics alike.\n\nIt's all in the game. Present day game theorists may quibble with Huizinga's idea of the magic circle that encompasses play, saying that the circle is really a square, or that it is contained by more of a dotted line than by an absolute boundary, but these are the arguments of academics who themselves have forgotten how to play with ideas, and find themselves struggling to find anything of their own to say under the deadlines of publish-or-perish. In the competition between useful ideas, their critiques lose to Huizinga's vision without putting up much of a fight.\n\nVideo game designers are among the most enthusiastic readers of Homo Ludens these days. They would do well to attend to Huizinga's link of play in general, and games in particular, to ritual. A ritual understanding of the player experience with video games could lead to surprising, entertaining, and profitable developments in the game industry.",

Well, Robert is correct, HOMO LUDENS is the authoritative read on the subject. And quite a fine example of writing too. Elegant, eloquent, and artful, though I did need to have a dictionary handy. Again, how anyone can think the translation is of poor quality is beyond my understanding because of the vocabulary used. It is definitely of high quality. This is one of those life-changing books that is hard to put down, and when it's over, you wish there was more. Play in its highest form for sure. Highly recommended... - lc",
